<h2>What to Bring</h2>

<h3>Vital Stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tent (or space in someone else's)</li>
<li>Bedding - a sleeping bag and a pillow. It can get cold at night, so consider bringing an extra blanket</li>
<li>Clean clothes</li>
<li>A towel, shower gel, shampoo, soap, toothbrush, etc. (We have showers!)</li>
<li>Torch and extra batteries. The site will be well lit but there will be darker bits (e.g. inside your tent)</li>
<li>Food and/or money for food (the bar offers cashback on debit cards if you need more money)</li>
<li>Walking boots and/or wellies (the site is a field, good shoes are a must)</li>
<li>Waterproofs. This is the UK: it will probably rain</li>
<li>Warm clothing, for evenings and sleeping in if it gets cold</li>
<li>Medicines, hayfever tablets (you will be surrounded by hay bales all day)</li>
<li>Sun cream and/or a sun hat</li>
<li>Your EMF ticket (printed or saved on your phone - these will be issued shortly before the event)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Useful Things</h3>
<li>A 20-30m power lead. If you can, a 16A plug on the end is useful - <a href="">more info on power</a></li>
<li>A long (as long as the power lead) ethernet cable to connect your tent </li>
<li>A computer</li>
<li>A DECT phone to make and receive phone call via the local DECT network</li>
🇪🇺	Europe to UK plug adaptors (if you have non-UK equipment)
🔨	Making gear (for any/all of your hobbies)
☕	A water bottle and/or mug, useful for food & drink (when not got from vendors)

🖊️	Pen and paper
🚮	Bin bags (for rubbish and dirty clothes)
🔥	A few gold and silver space blankets and clothes pins to cover your tent and prevent it from turning into an oven in the morning sun
