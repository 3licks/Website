  Be the friendly face of the phone team for a few hours, helping attendees with their phone (DECT/SIP/GSM/POTS) related questions, we'll give you some brief training and access to a couple of systems to check and update things, there will be other people from the phone team around to back you up, we're happy to explain how the sytem (mostly) works too.
