<h2 id="volunteer-roles">Pre-event Volunteer Roles</h2>
<div class="intro-text">
  <p>We're looking for people to fill the roles listed below, please keep in mind that all of them require a time commitment ahead of the event.</p>
  <p>Some of these are entirely new roles for 2022, while others are making sure we have dedicated people focused on specific roles, rather than people taking on multiple roles.</p>
  <p>If any of these roles are of interest to you please send an email to <a href="mailto:volunteers@emfcamp.org">volunteers@emfcamp.org</a> and introduce yourself.</p>
</div>

<h3>First Aid Team Lead</h3>
<p>The first aid team ensure that medical help is available to everyone on site, from buildup all the way to tear down.</p>
<p>We're looking for someone to lead this team, ensuring all relevant policies are in place, and preparing the volunteer rota for first aid during the event, and booking any suppliers required such as paramedics.</p>
<p>The team lead is also responsible for working with the core orga team to ensure the event management plan properly covers any medical provisions required.</p>

<h3>Content Team Lead + Second</h3>
<p>Ahead of the event the content team are responsible for making sure there's something to do once you arrive at EMF, organising the talks, workshops, and installations around the site. They manage the CfP process, contact any invited speakers, and making sure any special requirements are dealt with.</p>
<p>Once on site, they make sure speakers are on the right stage at the right time, and manage the stage teams and heralds.</p>
<p>We're looking for both a team lead, and for someone to act as their second. In the run up to the event you should be able to commit to about 20 hours a month, particularly around the CfP opening and closing.</p>

<h3>Music Team Lead + Second</h3>
<p>Working with the content team the music team arrange artists to play on one of the main stages in the evening, and DJs for the Cybar dance floor.</p>
<p>You'll need to commit about 20 hours a month ahead of the event to find, contact, and book artists.</p>

<h3>Workshops Co-ordinator</h3>
<p>Working with the content team the workshops coordinator will organise which wrokshops are running at which locations, that all required equipment has been bought or hired, and that it's available in the right place.</p>

<h3>Volunteer Catering Manager</h3>
<p>The catering manager will work with the chefs to make sure all the required equipment has been hired or bought ahead of time, organise food deliveries, and manage the kitchen team rota during the event.</p>

<h3>Design Team</h3>
<p>In addition to the flags and beermats that may be familiar from the last EMF, for 2022 the new Design team will coordinate with other volunteers across EMF to help ensure the festival looks as cohesive and beautiful as possible, from the website to the wristbands to backgrounds for the stages.</p>
<p>We’re absolutely delighted to welcome logistics-minded volunteers who can wrangle suppliers and hands-on folks who can help build physical items.</p>

<h4>Graphic Designer</h4>
<p>We have a really exciting marine theme this year, including a corrupted/overgrown logo variant and deep sea luminescence colour palette.  We also have a CG artist who has offered to ‘grow’ assets for us.</p>
<p>We have a comprehensive plan for what needs to be created, but to stop Morag trying to design everything themselves we’re looking for people with skills in vector artwork and manipulation, desktop publishing and a tiny bit of web magic.</p>
<p>We would like help to create:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assets such as logo colour variations, background graphics</li>
  <li>A matching style guide</li>
  <li>A cosmetic update for the website to fit this year’s theme</li>
  <li>Swag including stickers, tshirts, lanyards, wristbands</li>
  <li>Printed materials such as the attendee booklet and postcards</li>
  <li>Stage flats to act as a background for speakers</li>
  <li>Video cards/graphic inserts for talk streams/recordings</li>
  <li>Signage</li>
  <li>Other Cool Things!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is quite a broad remit, and we’d welcome your help for whatever parts of it match your skills and interests.  There’s so much to do and about 6 months to do it in, but you’d be welcomed with a shower of concept sketches and the most comprehensive planning and support we can manage.  We’re doing our best to set everyone up to succeed, and to have a great time volunteering.</p>
