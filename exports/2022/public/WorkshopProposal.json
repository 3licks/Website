Whether it's coming from space, from radioactive elements in the Earth, or from human activity, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere we go, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is happening all the time, and curiously, some objects in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.\r\n\r\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-M\u00fcller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-M\u00fcller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. Attendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.",

Please diverge from my instructions if something else feels right. That's common, and kinda the point \u2014 particularly for the hypnotic induction, which needs to be tailored to your own experience).\r\n\r\nLikewise, if something feels uncomfortable or triggering, please switch to a different meditation exercise instead (e.g. the basic breath meditation we start with).\r\n\r\nWhat you share is entirely up to you. I won't call on you. If there's something you'd only be comfortable sharing privately, please find and talk with me at another time.",

Try scratching records on a set of Technics SL1210\u2019s and then get hands on with your own device and learning digital DJ skills and techniques.\r\n\r\nWe will primarily use Mixxx software for the workshop as it's so awesome as well as being open source and free, but other free options for tablets and phones are all possible. There will also be an opportunity to plug into a USB Mixer/controller and demo your new skills at the end! The ultimate aim of this workshop is to introduce some basics of DJ'ing. The kids also have the exciting option to DJ at their own Kids Disco later in the evening at 7:30pm!  Royalty free music will be available along with other guidance and options.\r\n\r\nPlease ask kids to wash hands prior to workshop and kids will also be asked to use hand sanitizer before touching shared DJ kit (if this is a concern don\u2019t worry, just take part in the workshop using your device that you brought). I will clean kit in between kids having a shot. Really grateful for patience and understanding.",

The mythical \"Philosopher's stone\" was thought to be the missing key needed for that, but much to the disappointment of generations of alchemists, the elusive Stone was never found, and the promise of unlimited wealth remained a dream. Until less than a century ago. \r\n\r\nWhen British physicist James Chadwick discovered the nature of the neutron in 1932, it soon became apparent that these subatomic particles can change the composition of an atom's nucleus. By adding neutrons to a nucleus, or removing neutrons from a nucleus, the atom can be made unstable and forced to undergo changes, now known as radioactive decay. These nuclear reactions can change an isotope of an element into another isotope of the same element, or even into an entirely different element. By choosing nuclear reactions and decays carefully, it becomes possible to turn other materials into gold. Traditionally, nuclear reactions require a very large and expensive nuclear reactor or particle accelerator, but a clever hacker doesn't need any of these! \r\n\r\nThis workshop starts with a 30 minute entry level introduction to nuclear physics to explain attendees the scientific principles of elemental transmutation. Attendees then build together their own Philosopher's stone with components that can be found in any hardware store, and finally use it to transmute (a few atoms) of liquid mercury into gold. After the workshop, attendees have the option to take their creation home.",

We will start by listening to our recordings to see if we can guess what we have found. We will then give a 15-min crash course on identifying eight types of invertebrates that can be found in rivers, each of which indicates different environmental conditions. Under the direction of workshop participants, our workshop leads will get into the river and collect some wiggly creatures. Everyone will count which species we have found and we will finish with a score that indicates how healthy or polluted the river is. If we have time, we will also demonstrate some simple tests to detect pollutants in the water. Participants will receive information to take home with them about different techniques that they can use to monitor river health for themselves, ranging from in-river surveys to Arduino sensor builds.\r\n\r\nWarning: We are not planning for participants to go in the water, but they may come into contact with the water so please cover up any cuts or broken skin.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot make our workshop time slot then do come across to our \"what's in the water\" village - we plan to be around at midday on Fri / Sat to run informal workshops.",

Macrame was first brought by Arabs to Spain and after spread from Spain to Italy and eventually to the rest of Europe. Sailors played a large role in keeping Macram\u00e9 alive and sharing the art with new lands. Knots had many practical uses aboard their ships and decorative knot-tying kept hands and minds occupied during long voyages.\r\nModern macrame is having a huge revival. The repetitive tying of knots is soothing and meditative and great for mindfulness. It is also a craft that requires very little \u2013 just cord and scissors. There are few basic knots in macrame and, once you have mastered them, the possibilities of what you can create are endless.\r\n\r\nDuring the workshop we will create a crossbody water flask holder/carrier using cotton string.\r\nThe basic model requires about 15 meters of cord and around 60 knots in total - cotton cord and the printed instructions will be provided.

Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.\r\n\r\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-M\u00fcller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-M\u00fcller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. Attendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.",

Using 4 channels of 8-bit sampled sound and a maximum of around 1MB of ram, making something sound good requires a few tricks.\r\n\r\nI'd like to share the mystery and wonder of Protracker - the Esperanto of tracker software - to a wider audience. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop we'll demonstrate:\r\n\r\nhow to sample your own sounds\r\nhow to rip samples from other peoples mods\r\nwhere to find decent mods\r\nhow to remix mods\r\nhow to edit samples using amiga software\r\nhow to loop samples cleanly\r\nhow to make protracker patterns, and then assemble patterns into a song.\r\n\r\nYou can follow along with a laptop and headphones!  You'll just need to install fs-uae (https://fs-uae.net) on linux or mac, or winuae (https://www.winuae.net/) on Windows **before** the workshop.  We'll be using ProTracker 2.3d from back in the day, or ProTracker 2.3f which is a recently bugfixed version.  https://github.com/8bitbubsy/pt23f\r\n\r\nIf you've never seen a tracker, it's like a spreadsheet where each row plays a bunch of sounds.  Load a few samples, start it recording, and you can quickly make fun and catchy patterns using instruments, speech, singing, or drum loops.\r\n\r\nAbout your instructor.\r\n\r\nI was exposed to mods and amiga game music in the early 90s and my mind was thoroughly blown.  Through cover disks and PD (public domain) libraries I discovered Med, Sound Tracker, and  Octamed, all classic trackers.  But it was in 1993 when I joined the Amiga demoscene as a young teen that my eyes, ears, and mind were really opened.  Donning the handle Reflex, I first joined a group called Eltech and then later Grasshopper Developments, two mid-tier demogroups of the UK scene. Protracker was the standard that literally everybody on the scene used. I didn't release tons of stuff back then, but I was horse famous for a bit with some cheeky chip tunes and sampled songs about grasshoppers.",
