What\u2019s followed has been invigorating and challenging, but it\u2019s not been easy. In England, skills gaps are a problem. In other parts of the UK there seems to be more of a \u201csit back and wait to see how those English people get on\u201d attitude. For the enthusiastic outreach nerd, this is an interesting time: working in after school clubs, one-day sessions, robot open days, summer camps, and tech activity development can be hugely fun and massively rewarding. It can also be utterly frustrating, demoralising, and can sap the life force from your very soul (if you had one to start with). \r\n\r\nThis talk will describe what works, what doesn\u2019t work, what you (yes you) can do, and why we should take this seriously. What should you do if you\u2019re trying to run a workshop for 40 kids with varying levels of experience? How can you help a group of homeschooling parents teach programming? How can you write something that\u2019s used more than once? \r\n\r\nThe currently anonymous proposer has a decade+ of experience as a tech person trying to encourage the world that tech is actually fun.

We are a Not For Profit venture and are working on open sourcing the project because having an open source design and data protocol will open up the avenues to information and equipment it can link into and information it can display. Available displays are at best two lines, Canute will be 8 or 16 lines and affordable.\r\n\r\nThe blind community are currently poorly supported with literature as very little is transferred to bulky Braille paper format and this has an impact on literacy and employment and access to modern communication. So much information is displayed 'on the screen' and Text-To-Speech is not always convenient (and is often inconvenient) and is a very different experience to reading. We aim to reverse this with CANUTE which will be the world's first electronic multi-line refreshable Braille display. It will be an entirely new class of affordable device to bring Braille to people who would otherwise be unable to afford anything other than massive, bulky hard copy Braille from a very limited source.\r\n\r\nAfter 4 years of development on gifted and sponsored budgets in the corner of a Hackspace using Chinese motors and gears from ebay, lasercut parts and 3D printed widgets crammed into a fat laptop sized box, with an Arduino brain and Raspberry Pi book library we have made a working prototype that can display an entire page of Braille.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no machine available to demonstrate. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bristolbraille.co.uk/",

Some time ago impressioning locks got \"re-invented\" by the lockpick community and the skill evolved to the level now shown at several international championships. \r\n\r\nUnlike lockpicking, impressioning creates a fully working key for the lock which can be used to lock and unlock the cylinder at will.

We'll move on to briefly examine his formulation of digital logic circuits in Boolean algebra and present his design of a 4-bit adder circuit in relay logic.

We are all familiar with using the speed of this clock to reason about the performance of our devices: in 2000, a desktop might have run at 500MHz; now, it would not be unheard of to see a 5GHz clock. The existence of this clock makes processor design very convenient, and in the early days clocked designs generally proved faster and used fewer components than their unclocked counterparts.\r\n\r\nHowever, in recent years we have seen a plateau in increasing clock speeds: computers are no longer getting \"faster\", per se. We have uncovered many disadvantages of using clocked circuits: the clock is power-hungry, it is difficult to distribute across a modern chip, all circuits are constrained to operate at the speed of the slowest, and clocks may cause electromagnetic interference to other nearby devices.\r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the human brain, this talk will examine two fundamentally different methods of computation that are either asynchronous or analogue in nature. They do not rely on a clock to advance the state. We shall simulate and explore these methods through interactive, graphical means. Asynchronous circuits have the potential to be faster than clocked designs and require far less power. Electronic analogue computers have the further advantage that they do not suffer from numerical errors that arise from approximating real numbers using a finite number of bits. Might one of these techniques shape the future of our technological society?",

Tool-assisted speedruns are recorded frame-by-frame using emulators which allow slow-motion gameplay, going back and undoing mistakes, and even using bots to search through many possible combinations of inputs. By removing human limitations, these speedruns get closer and closer to the theoretically perfect play.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents highlights from the last 15 years: frame-perfect movements, exploiting bugs and oversights, and manipulating randomness to get miraculously good fortune. There will be videos of speed runs, including both popular and obscure games, and even a game completed in less than 0.3 seconds of gameplay time.\r\n\r\nThere are many techniques which are used in making a speedrun. Sometimes people will disassemble the game's code to understand how it works, in order to find new ways of beating it. Sometimes people will find and exploit bugs, allowing them to move through walls, go faster than normally possible, or skip whole sections of the game. In extreme cases, bugs allow players to execute arbitrary code, allowing them to take complete control of the console.\r\n\r\nIn short, this talk is about taking games to their very limits.\r\n\r\n",

What does a train travelling through a station indicate about simultaneous events and how do railway junctions lead to problems in ethics? This talk combines several interesting problems in railway operation, within the context of real railway operations, showing surprising applications in computing they inspired.\r\n\r\nShunting yards present logistical problems arising from the marshalling of wagons. The UK's former largest yard near Sheffield was so complex it required a paper tape era computer to operate. However, in computing we find their structure used in diagrams for programming language grammars and a type of parsing algorithm known as the shunting yard algorithm which we'll see in operation.\r\n\r\nThe computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra devised many railway-themed computing ideas. Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest route between stations, a method independently discovered by early rail planners in the UK. Thanks to railway signalling, Dijkstra introduced semaphores into concurrent programming. We'll show how the concept works both for railways and concurrent systems and outline the historical context of rail accidents.\r\n\r\nRailways introduced universal time. Einstein's celebrated thought experiment involving a moving train changed how we understood simultaneous events. Distributed systems rely on proper ordering of events. We'll explore these problems plus solutions.\r\n\r\nThe talk includes the Trolley Problem that first arose in philosophy but is now the subject of its own vibrant meme.",

Of course, it is understandable that these details regarding these systems will never become available to the general public for security reasons.\r\nDue to my background in security, I always looked at the airplanes from a different perspective and after reading so many articles online I decided to share with you what I have come across after all these years. Personally, I am an airplane enthusiast and I have been studying and learning about airplanes all my life, mostly as a hobby.

It will also publicise to a journalistic standard the extent to which its use is growing, Police use of social media images, and the government's attempts to brush concerns under the proverbial rug.",

We decided to try our best to represent the all community and during two weeks we explored the Lab meeting new people, discovering their projects and scavenging for physical artifacts. We ended up spelling the title of the article out of physical objects including a DIY air liquifier, the internal mechanism of a robotic underwater anemone, LEGO blocks, a robotic prosthesis, a hyperviolin, a gyroscopically stabilized electric unicycle or a Mobile Social Dextrous robot. Through this story I want to present the Media Lab from my own experience of working there but also explore the notion of the cohesion of such a place behind the happy chaos of a pluridisciplinar and pluricultural  community.\r\n",

The last couple of years have seen breaches that are bigger, and of a higher profile, than ever before. When we trace these breaches back to their cause, we often find that attackers took advantage of human behaviour, via social engineering, poor password management, gaps in physical security or malicious insiders. Organisations are increasingly focused on raising cyber security awareness, and the UK government has spent millions of pounds on the Cyber Streetwise campaign, and yet we seem to be making little (if any) progress when it comes to changing behaviours. \r\n\r\nThis talk argues that, in lots of ways, we are making fundamental mistakes when it comes to our attempts to raise awareness. Combining sociological and psychological research with mythology and classic horror fiction, this talk highlights lessons we can learn in our approach to raising cyber security awareness. Emphasising ways we can positively engage with people to change behaviours for the better, this talk aims to provoke ideas and discussions that will lead to awareness-raising programmes that are focused on what the 'user' needs to know, and how we should be telling them, to achieve the most impact and make cyber security less of a monster.",

Instead of building complex and expensive robots, we  build simple and cheap robots. This allows us to construct a lot of robots and use them as a swarm. Just like computer engineers found out that some problems (e.g. travelling sales man) can be solved by copying behaviour seen in nature, the same thing applies to hardware. For example, we see that animals have multiple layers of intelligence: reflexes needed to stay alive are generated by the spine, and the brain adds a layer of more complex, but less stable intelligence. This can be copied to robots by implementing the spine in a microcontroller, and implementing the brain on a processor running linux. These robots are build in all sizes. Ranging from a model you can hold in your hand, up to a model that is over half a meter in length.",

The spark that started this bike was from an engine given to me at my 40th birthday camping weekend. You'd think it was a thoughtful and expensive gift but my friends actually found it on top of a rubbish dump attached to an abandoned refrigeration unit. However it was of good stock and worth mending and eventually made its way into a bike that covered over 40000 miles before needing attention. \r\n\r\nAnother interesting fact is that I built it in about a week due to a personal crisis. It was built mostly in the spare room of my house using parts I had I the attic left over from other projects and support from a generous friend with a big lathe. \r\n\r\nI have attend the annual diesel bike meeting regularly since it started eleven years ago as well as occasionally visiting the one in Germany so can chat about the broader community of diesel bike builders.",
