The only tickets you need to print out are for parking (which need
to be displayed on your dashboard). Your other tickets you can
print out or we'll check them from a phone.

If you have bought a ticket for someone else you can send it to them
by logging in, clicking 'transfer' beside the relevant ticket,
and filling in the form:

If you're coming by car and you don't have a parking ticket, you'll
need to buy one before you arrive:

If you're travelling by public transport, we will be running shuttle
buses between a local train station and the festival site.

For more details about how to get to EMF, including shuttle bus times
and driving directions, please see the Travel section of our wiki:

And lastly, EMF is entirely volunteer-run. Please consider
contributing a few hours of your time at the festival to help the
event run smoothly.
