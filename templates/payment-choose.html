<p>Taking credit card payments for a small event like us is really expensive, so the only
   payment methods we accept are bank-to-bank. If this is really a problem for you, please
   <a href="mailto:{{ config.get('TICKETS_EMAIL')[1] }}">let us know</a>.
</p>

<table class="table table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr><th>Ticket Type</th><th>amount</th><th>Price each</th></tr>

{% for tt in basket %}
<tr>
<td>
{{ tt.name }}
</td>
<td>
{{ basket[tt] }}
</td>
<td>
{{ format_price(tt.cost) }}
</td>

{% endfor %}

<p>Total <b>{{ format_price(amount) }}</b></p>

<p>Your tickets aren't quite reserved yet!  Please choose a payment method below to buy your tickets.</p>

<h3>Paying in Pounds or Euros</h3>

<p>The best way is to ask your bank to send it to us directly (this works online, or with cash in
branch).</p>

<form method="post" action="{{ url_for('transfer_start') }}">
<p><input type=submit name=banktransfer value="Pay by bank transfer"/></p>
</form>

<h3>Paying by Direct Debit</h3>

<p>Alternatively, choose GoCardless to create a one-off direct debit from your account.
GoCardless payments are protected by the 
<a href="http://www.thesmartwaytopay.co.uk/DirectDebitHelpCentre/Pages/DirectDebitGuarantee.aspx">Direct Debit
Guarantee</a>.</p>

<form method="post" action="{{ url_for('gocardless_start') }}">
<p><input type=submit name=gocardless value="Pay with GoCardless"/></p>
</form>
