            "description": "A dazzling, surprising and sometimes hilarious animation in three different styles that interprets a ancient Indian story. Roger Ebert declared \u201cI was enchanted. I was swept away\u201d.\n\nSita is a Hindu goddess, the leading lady of India\u2019s epic the Ramayana and a dutiful wife who follows her husband Rama on a 14 year exile to a forest, only to be kidnapped by an evil king from Sri Lanka.  Despite remaining faithful to her husband, Sita is put through many tests. Nina (the filmmaker Nina Paley herself) is an artist who finds parallels in Sita\u2019s life when her husband \u2013 in India on a work project - decides to break up their marriage and dump her via email. Three hilarious Indonesian shadow puppets with Indian accents \u2013 linking the popularity of the Ramayana from India all the way to the Far East - narrate both the ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this beautifully animated interpretation of the epic.\n\nIn her first feature length film, Paley juxtaposes multiple narrative and visual styles to create a highly entertaining yet moving vision of the Ramayana. Musical numbers choreographed to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw feature a cast of hundreds: flying monkeys, evil monsters, gods, goddesses, warriors, sages, and winged eyeballs. A tale of truth, justice and a woman\u2019s cry for equal treatment. Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline as \\\"The Greatest Break-Up Story Ever Told.\u201d From: www.sitasingstheblues.com",

You are then able to plug in your headphones and hear these sounds that are normally outside of our hearing range, from the sound of ants footsteps to those of a spider, any insect.\n\nIf it's too loud to hear the insect on camp, there are recordings of the sounds of ants to hear and you can still test the mike out in its shoe box. It can detect lost of other everyday sounds that we wouldn't normally hear.\n\nBring an insect if you find one and lets try!\n\nhttp://minusonic.designbywatson.com/\n",
