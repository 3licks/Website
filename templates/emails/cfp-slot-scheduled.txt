Things to note:

* If you have special requirements and have not spoken to our speaker ops team about them, please reply to this email.

* Please report to the Green Room 30 minutes before your {{ proposal.type }} so that the speaker ops team can make sure everything is ready for you, and your {{ proposal.type}} will go as smoothly as possible!

* It is possible that we may have to reschedule your {{ proposal.type }} before the event starts, so please make sure you've told us when you can speak in your final details: https://www.emfcamp.org/login?next=%2Fcfp%2Fproposals%2F{{ proposal.id }}%2Ffinalise

* You can also update your talk title and description at any time using the link above, so make sure it sounds great!

* While you are allowed on-stage Q&A within your slot, we would prefer it if you asked the audience to meet you somewhere afterwards to discuss it.

Looking forward to seeing you in the field,
The EMF Speaker Ops Team
