Hi {{ user.name }},

A while back you paid a deposit for {% if payment.tickets.all() | count > 1 %}{{ payment.tickets.all() |count }} tickets{% else %}a ticket{% endif %}
to Electromagnetic Field 2012. We're now able to accept taking the remaining payment.

The remainder you need to pay is £60 per ticket, for a total ticket price of £90.
To pay, please visit our site and buy a "Full Camp Ticket (prepay)" for each ticket you need:

{{ url_for('login', next='/tickets/choose') }}

We'd really appreciate it if you paid promptly, as it'll help us with our cashflow. If you haven't paid by
Friday August 10th, we will reallocate your ticket.

We've still got quite a few tickets to sell, so please spread the word,
and follow us on Twitter and Facebook:

In the unlikely event you want to cancel your prepaid ticket, please email tickets@emfcamp.org and we'll refund you, minus a £10 admin fee.

See you soon at EMF 2012! 

Love,

All the EMF team
