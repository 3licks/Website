Robot care companions are already in use today. Are we at a stage where we can find love and sex with robots? What makes a sex toy a sex robot? Should we (literally and figuratively) embrace them? There are the ethical, legal and policy questions: should we ban them? Is it cheating? Is it consensual? What if someone makes a celeb robot? Or a child robot? Can they cure loneliness? Can they cure sex offenders? Will they rise up against us come the Singularity? And who will own all that sex data and what will happen to it? Why are all the current sex robots made by men for men? Why do robots have a gender anyway? And if we gave a robot genitals, what would they look like...? Come along, find out, and have a go at answering some of these questions and more. &#13;

What does a train travelling through a station indicate about simultaneous events and how do railway junctions lead to problems in ethics? This talk combines several interesting problems in railway operation, within the context of real railway operations, showing surprising applications in computing they inspired.&#13;
&#13;
Shunting yards present logistical problems arising from the marshalling of wagons. The UK's former largest yard near Sheffield was so complex it required a paper tape era computer to operate. However, in computing we find their structure used in diagrams for programming language grammars and a type of parsing algorithm known as the shunting yard algorithm which we'll see in operation.&#13;
&#13;
The computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra devised many railway-themed computing ideas. Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest route between stations, a method independently discovered by early rail planners in the UK. Thanks to railway signalling, Dijkstra introduced semaphores into concurrent programming. We'll show how the concept works both for railways and concurrent systems and outline the historical context of rail accidents.&#13;
&#13;
Railways introduced universal time. Einstein's celebrated thought experiment involving a moving train changed how we understood simultaneous events. Distributed systems rely on proper ordering of events. We'll explore these problems plus solutions.&#13;
&#13;
The talk includes the Trolley Problem that first arose in philosophy but is now the subject of its own vibrant meme.</abstract><description>How might you re-order wagons in trains without lifting them off the tracks or prevent trains from colliding when you cannot see where they are?

The project has been developed using Bristol Hackspace as a base and workshop facility.

&#13;
The blind community are currently poorly supported with literature as very little is transferred to bulky Braille paper format and this has an impact on literacy and employment and access to modern communication. So much information is displayed 'on the screen' and Text-To-Speech is not always convenient (and is often inconvenient) and is a very different experience to reading. We aim to reverse this with CANUTE which will be the world's first electronic multi-line refreshable Braille display. It will be an entirely new class of affordable device to bring Braille to people who would otherwise be unable to afford anything other than massive, bulky hard copy Braille from a very limited source.&#13;

After 4 years of development on gifted and sponsored budgets in the corner of a Hackspace using Chinese motors and gears from ebay, lasercut parts and 3D printed widgets crammed into a fat laptop sized box, with an Arduino brain and Raspberry Pi book library we have made a working prototype that can display an entire page of Braille.&#13;

Mainstream journalists and bloggers have started writing about us, giving people outside the maker community an impression of who we are and what we do without them ever setting foot in a hackspace or maker faire.&#13;
So are we still a DIY grassroots knowledge-sharing community? Are our hackspaces as open and inclusive as we think (or thought) they are? Do we still have the same values that we did when the first UK hackspaces opened seven years ago? And are most makers still white middle-class dudes?&#13;
In this talk I present the results-in-progress of my Masters research into the state of the UK maker community in 2016. It will be the result of conversations with makers from all areas of the community (hackspace members, FabLab staff, creative freelancers, university students, maker faire exhibitors), plus non-makers, to find out how we see ourselves and how other people see us. It's the first step in a larger research project to find out how we can make our community more inclusive and how we can reach under-represented audiences.</abstract><description>There's been some big changes in the UK maker community over the past couple of years: the number of makerspaces and hackspaces around the country has mushroomed, private makerspaces have popped up in companies and universities, and "maker" has become a buzzword for corporate PR departments.

In this talk I explain the origins of the term &#8220;information overload&#8221; and describe what physiological and psychological effects being overloaded causes. With reference to developing for the web, I describe specific, manageable sources of information overload for us as developers and show how development in general is a continuous learning process.&#13;

In order to hack our how we learn, it&#8217;s important to understand a little about how learning happens. To that end, I outline the points of attack by relating the current understanding from the field of cognitive psychology on how our thinking and learning processes work.&#13;
&#13;
I&#8217;ll use simple examples throughout to show how we can manage our projects more effectively, write clearer, more maintainable code, and actively manage our own learning journeys, as well as assisting the journeys of those we work alongside. With this knowledge we should be able to make our development process more efficient and reduce the risk of information overload both for ourselves and others.</abstract><description>There are limits to our ability to learn and process information, but the amount of information we have access to is growing faster than ever.&#13;

There are hundreds of rubbish USB devices around with unsupported software and locked down pc requirements. Luckily, these devices are often actually very easy to reverse engineer. I'll briefly outline how USB works, and then describe how I reverse engineered several USB devices - including a USB desktop visualiser (avermedia CP-155) and a laser cutter (HPC 3020) using just virtual machines and wireshark, and found that many undocumented USB devices are surprisingly simple.

The drive to do such an unusual thing was partly the engineering challenge but mostly the amazing fuel economy and I now  get about 140mpg from it. The spark that started this bike was from an engine given to me at my 40th birthday camping weekend. You'd think it was a thoughtful and expensive gift but my friends actually found it on top of a rubbish dump attached to an abandoned refrigeration unit. However it was of good stock and worth mending and eventually made its way into a bike that covered over 40000 miles before needing attention. &#13;
&#13;
Another interesting fact is that I built it in about a week due to a personal crisis. It was built mostly in the spare room of my house using parts I had I the attic left over from other projects and support from a generous friend with a big lathe. &#13;

There are many techniques which are used in making a speedrun. Sometimes people will disassemble the game's code to understand how it works, in order to find new ways of beating it. Sometimes people will find and exploit bugs, allowing them to move through walls, go faster than normally possible, or skip whole sections of the game. In extreme cases, bugs allow players to execute arbitrary code, allowing them to take complete control of the console.&#13;

The facts I am going to present you with will help you better understand if what you reading about airplanes' security is actually true or a misleading story based on fictional facts and assumptions. &#13;
The presentation will allow you to draw your own conclusions about the security of airplanes' avionics and in-flight systems while looking a bit closer to the so called in-flight entertainment systems. &#13;

Asynchronous circuits have the potential to be faster than clocked designs and require far less power. Electronic analogue computers have the further advantage that they do not suffer from numerical errors that arise from approximating real numbers using a finite number of bits.

If anyone's interested, I'll also talk them through the derivation of the speed of light from Maxwell's equations. </description><slug>emf2016-38-backyard-optics</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="218">Dan Weatherill</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="14dd107e-d409-5de5-ad70-25a7c132b03d" id="362"><room>Workshop 1</room><title>Kite Mapping Part 2</title><type>workshop</type><date>2016-08-07T11:10:00+01:00</date><start>11:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>this workshop is cancelled as we didn't get photos yesterday, so there's nothing to stitch together.&#13;

A-Frame is a beginner-friendly but capable entity-component framework by Mozilla folks to create VR experiences from markup and code. &#13;
&#13;
Everyone who can slide a smartphone into a cardboard is welcome for this workshop. I will teach the basics and cover some advanced concepts like coding interactions and components with JavaScript. But mostly you will explore and experiment. &#13;
&#13;
After the workshop everyone should have a good understanding to create their own VR worlds in a few lines of markup/code. Imperfect VR: We are not aiming for a perfect reality but will have fun in the virtual. Cheap 3D assets. Blocky textures. Weird sounds. We want to stumble around the EMF campground with smartphones in our faces. Forget VR mainstream. Motion sickness will not be avoided but guaranteed.&#13;

Whilst he is most widely known as the "father of information theory", the extent of his influence across computer science, physics and engineering is incredible. This talk aims to mark his centenary with an exploration of the man, his work and his legacy. In the spirit of his practical, "hands-on" nature, our discussion will be filled with examples, experiments and demonstrations.&#13;
&#13;
The talk will start by explaining his unifying theory of the transmission of information, which provides the basis for all modern communication: without his work we would have no Internet, no mobile telephones, and no theoretical understanding of the limits of data compression. We'll move on to briefly examine his formulation of digital logic circuits in Boolean algebra and present his design of a 4-bit adder circuit in relay logic. Finally, we'll conclude by exploring some of his lesser-known inventions: the first computerised learning device, the first chess-playing computer program, the first wearable computer, a juggling robot, and the "ultimate machine".</abstract><description>Claude Elwood Shannon was a pioneering mathematician and engineer, of paramount importance in our digital revolution. 2016 sees the centenary of his birth.

Alas, there currently exists no regulation of AFR in the UK... but its use by British police forces is on the up. Despite the warnings of independent oversight bodies (and court rulings against the police collection of custody images) the government has continued to underwhelm in its response to yet another State capacity for surveillance.&#13;

This talk will cover to a scientific standard the increasing capabilities of the technology, and question the limits of its scalability, as well as tackle popular ideas about how to defend against it. It will also publicise to a journalistic standard the extent to which its use is growing, Police use of social media images, and the government's attempts to brush concerns under the proverbial rug.</abstract><description>A talk on the use of automated facial recognition (AFR) systems in the UK.&#13;

A method to do this has existed for quite some time, but until recently it has remained quite unknown. Some time ago impressioning locks got "re-invented" by the lockpick community and the skill evolved to the level now shown at several international championships. &#13;
&#13;
Unlike lockpicking, impressioning creates a fully working key for the lock which can be used to lock and unlock the cylinder at will. With practice, this technique can consistently open a lock in 10-15 minutes (and potentially faster)!&#13;

What is it? How does it work? What skill is involved? Why is it the most interesting way to open a lock? These questions, and more will be answered in this talk.&#13;
