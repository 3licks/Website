** Team Lead ** Sam Cook

Help park cars, and get people on/off site.

This role can involve quite a lot of walking, and standing in the sun and/or rain, but it is also super useful, and can be picked up very quickly.

You need to make sure that the Accessible Parking is kept clear for those that need it; similarly the EV area.

We do not require any proof that someone needs to use accessible parking; if they say they do - they do. They can get a permit at the entrance tent.
