Alongside our practice we organise art and science events and exhibitions, with the aim of bringing artists, scientists and technologists together to make new work and projects.\r\n\r\nI would like to create a black-lit installation that explores light bodies and invisible patterns. \r\nI created a similar installation for a recent exhibition called VOID at St John on Bethnal Green church. EMF represents a great opportunity to take the tensile piece into the outdoors and also meet folk with tech skills who might be interested in collaborating.\r\n\r\nFor EMF I would like to create the installation between trees with black and fluorescent green fishing wire. By night the upward section of the installation would be visible with black light. By day, the underside structure would be visible. \r\n\r\nI can bear the material costs and time, but it would be great to have a small amount towards transport. It would take 1.5 days to install. \r\nAll i would need from EMF is power supply (2 gang). ",

They will perceive their environment; see the natural environment in a different way after plugging in and hearing a different type of music.\r\n\r\nThe electronic engineering takes a small microphone that is amplified with an operational amplifier chip (op amp); the amplification is controlled by a potentiometer and then fed to a power amplifier to increase the audio level. The microphone is then enclosed in a paper cone to funnel the inputs from the ant/insect into the microphone. \r\n\r\nIn addition to hearing the microcosmic sounds the insects inside The Nature Chamber make, we can also send these analogue inputs through an Arduino to control video. See example https://youtu.be/Q08AgVP_yIE\r\n\r\nThese inputs are fed through a Max Msp patch converting the Arduino serial data to midi to be compatible as a trigger for pause and play in Resolume Arena of a selected video.  In essence each \u2018footstep\u2019 (insect input) will trigger a frame of the video, the more frequent the inputs coming from The Nature Chamber the faster the frames of the video are triggered. ",

And with new RGB LED strip, individual controllers per pole, sophisticated sound generators, and improved computer vision, it\u2019ll be better than ever!\r\n\r\nThe\u00b7Grid debuted at EMF 2014 with an array of 49 poles mounted with white LEDs and clicker-sounders.  Combined with computer control and a variety of patterns, the result was a mesmerizing experience for hundreds of revellers.  This time, we have some improvements in mind.  We'd replace the centralised switching with dimmable controllers per pole to back up the colourful new RGB LEDs.  We're also adding a programmable sounder to each pole for a wider variety of immersive aural effects.  Finally, we have plans to improve the computer vision system, enhancing the interactivity that many people enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWe expect the improvements to cost around \u00a3700: \u00a3350 for new LED strip and \u00a3350 for the new controller electronics.  We can cover the electronics cost, if EMF could give us \u00a3350 for the new LED strip.\r\n\r\nAs previously, we require around 24 by 14m of unlit ground, and mains power (1.2kW peak).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to http://www.thegrid.fish/proposal2.pdf which includes a risk assessment and more detailed plans.",

It uses a set of Optitrack high speed infrared motion capture cameras to fly standard Hubsan X4 toy quadcopters under precision computer control, within a bounded indoor area. It is currently capable of very accurate hover, and scripted flight between given positions. I'm working on more aerobatic capabilities and would aim to have these ready by the camp, but can't guarantee it.\r\n\r\nAs well as pre-made demonstrations, I would propose to expose a simple public API that anyone could use to write their own flight scripts and run them on the system. The system would try to prevent API users from doing anything that could cause a crash. More ambitious visitors could perhaps get involved with lower level hacking on the system.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have a small number of vehicles, and the cameras are on fixed wall mounts at the Edinburgh Hacklab. In order to bring the system to EMF I would need to build and transport a rigid frame on which to mount the cameras, and stock up on vehicles and spare parts for inevitable losses during the event. If EMF could provide some scaffolding onsite this might help, and reduce cost.\r\n\r\nIf the system is to operate throughout the event some volunteer help would also be needed, as it needs a decent amount of babysitting, and I'd rather not be chained to it for the whole camp.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not I have hardly any videos of this right now but here's a hover test from early testing to prove I'm not talking out of my ass: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9RIgPPRbrw",

So they're pretty small, but it's intended to be spread over an area of a few tens of square metres.
