<p>We don't have a final budget yet, so we're currently only letting people
   put a deposit down for their tickets.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deposit pre-sales cost <strong>£30</strong> per ticket.</li>
    <li>They will entitle you to pay the rest of your ticket price at a £5 discount to the full ticket price.</li>
    <li>We anticipate the full ticket price to be between £75 and £100.
        If the final ticket price is over £100, you'll have to pay a £10 administration fee if you want a refund of your deposit.</li>
</ul>
