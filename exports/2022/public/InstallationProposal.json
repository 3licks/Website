Fluorescents aren't as efficient, have a 'warm up' time and generally contain not-so-nice substances like mercury; so it's easy to see why they are falling out of favour. \r\nHowever, we grew up in the era of the fluorescent tube: the 'plink plonk' as someone flicks the switch in a large room and the tubes flicker into life is something we don't want to forget. So we decided to build a giant 7-segment display out of fluorescent tubes. \r\nThe clock is driven by a single Raspberry Pi, and each digit sits on a CANbus. The display itself is driven by a 4511 through relays and opto-isolators. \r\n",

Evoking Orwell\u2019s vision of Newspeak as a language that \u201ccould only be used for one purpose\u201d, the project suggests that in a digital age, language is controlled and restricted by economic incentives, with similarly dystopian political consequences. \r\n\r\nWhat do you (double)think of the value of language in this dystopian linguistic market? You can find out the value of your own words by submitting texts to be monetised and displayed on the Newspeak ticker throughout the festival (details TBC).",

We will need help with:\r\n1. Location, we won't stay in our village much. Maybe Null Sector?\r\n2. Upgrades: a mannequin for a fortune teller would be nice if feasible.

Accessibility: It'll come on a Raspi/mobile with a small passive speaker, but a better speaker could help, and a monitor could be nice for the hard of hearing to get their \"fortunes\".\r\n\r\nIf these are too much we can talk about it, figure things out!\r\n\r\nI'll probably volunteer at setup so we can figure some of it out then.\r\n\r\nDemonstrations of current status:\r\nhttps://www.idrive.com/idrive/sh/sh?k=p6k9d6e2f3\r\nhttps://www.idrive.com/idrive/sh/sh?k=k2p6a4v1x9",
