  <p>Some of the roles are new this year whilst others are portions of previous positions in order to lighten the load 
     on other volunteers</p>
  <p>If any of these roles are of interest to you please send an email to <a
      href="mailto:volunteers@emfcamp.org">volunteers@emfcamp.org</a> and introduce yourself.</p>

  love to hear from you - but this is not required.</p>

  support tools so attendees can easily write code for the badge and experiment
  with other's code. We're looking for people with experience in web frontend
  technologies, python, and an eye for design &amp; UX.</p>
