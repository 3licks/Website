Hello {{ user.name }}!

With Electromagnetic Field fast approaching, here are your tickets
and some more details about the event. The gates will open at 10am on
Thursday 2nd June {#- 2022 #} to allow you to set up and get comfortable, and our
programme of content kicks off at midday on Friday.

Unless you're helping out with teardown, you should aim to leave by
midday on Monday 6th June {#- 2022 #}.

Cheers and see you soon!

The EMF Team
