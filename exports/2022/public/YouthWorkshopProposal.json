There will also be an opportunity to plug into a USB Mixer/controller and demo your new skills at the end! The ultimate aim of this workshop is to introduce some basics of DJ'ing. The kids also have the exciting option to DJ at their own Kids Disco later in the evening at 7:30pm!  Royalty free music will be available along with other guidance and options.\r\n\r\nPlease ask kids to wash hands prior to workshop and kids will also be asked to use hand sanitizer before touching shared DJ kit (if this is a concern don\u2019t worry, just take part in the workshop using your device that you brought).
