<h2>About Electromagnetic Field</h2>
<p>Imagine a camping festival with a power grid and high-speed internet
access; a temporary village of geeks, crafters, and technology enthusiasts
that's lit up by night, and buzzing with activity during the day.
Over a thousand curious people will descend on our
<a href="https://www.emfcamp.org/code-of-conduct">friendly open space</a> to learn,
share, and talk about what they love.</p>

<div class="row">

</div>

<p>Over a long weekend, you can expect to see a huge variety of talks across three stages,
a slew of workshops, as well as music, games, and installations dotted around the site.</p>

<p>At <a href="{{url_for('talks_2012')}}">previous events</a> we've heard talks about everything
from genetic modification to electronics,
blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering to lock picking,
computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to brewing.</p>

<p>We're inviting attendees to set up their own <a href="https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Villages">villages</a>
&mdash; camps within the camp &mdash;
where like-minded people can camp together and put on their own activities. Our hard-working team
of volunteers will supply you with power and internet to your tent.</p>

<p>Our internet connection &mdash; last time it was 380 megabits, this time we're aiming for
much more &mdash; will be beamed in from a datacenter nearby, and distributed to your tent by
(hopefully) the most reliable conference WiFi network you'll ever use.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to take advantage of our well-stocked bar selling great beer, cider, and
soft drinks at distinctly non-festival prices. Sadly we can't get hold of the motorway
bridge that housed the bar at our last site.</p>

<div class="row">

<p>When you arrive, you'll be issued with an <a href="http://blog.emfcamp.org/post/94157161753/announcing-tilda-mke-the-incredible-emf-2014-camp">attendee badge</a> unlike any you've seen before. Our
badge is a full-blown Arduino-powered computer with an LCD screen and wireless connectivity. During
EMF, you'll be able to view the schedule of talks on your badge. After the event, instead of sitting
in a drawer, it's fully reprogrammable to do whatever you want. If you don't know how, you can learn
at the event!

<p>For the first time, we're also very happy to be providing <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/blog/news/ucl-engineering-provide-childcare-uk-technology-festival/">full childcare</a> thanks to the generous
support of <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk">UCL Engineering</a>.</p>

<p>What makes Electromagnetic Field unique is that everything is created by attendees like you.
The entire event &mdash; stewarding, water, electricity, internet, stages, toilets, and the bar &mdash;
is organised by a dedicated team of volunteers, and everyone who turns up does their part to
make the event an amazing place to be for a weekend.
We're a non-profit organisation, so every penny you spend on your ticket goes towards making the event happen.</p>

<p>Expect to run into

<p>We hope we've given you a taste of what EMF is all about, but you have to be there
to experience it all. <strong>Tickets are <a href="{{ url_for('tickets_choose')}}">on sale now</a></strong>
