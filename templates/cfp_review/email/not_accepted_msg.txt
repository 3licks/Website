Hi {{ user.name }},

We've just closed a round of the Electromagnetic Field Call for Participation. Unfortunately your {{ proposal.type }} "{{ proposal.title }}" was not selected but has been automatically added to the next round.

Don't panic, there's several more rounds to come - if it's accepted in another round we'll let you know (later rounds are larger).

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in contact:

Thanks,
The EMF Team
