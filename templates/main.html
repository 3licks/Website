<h2>What?</h2>

<p class="summary">
Electromagnetic Field is a three-day camping festival for people with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, geeks, scientists, engineers, artists, and craftspeople.
</p>
<p class="summary">
A great gathering of specialists, enthusiasts, and newcomers from many disciplines, with talks and workshops on a wide range of subjects, and many opportunities to collaborate or have a drink with someone new.
</p>
<p>
A festival for anyone interested in 3D printing, DIYBio, knitting, electronics, Internet culture, space, lockpicking, homebrewing, robots, UAVs, mind hacking, radio, or pretty much anything else you can think of. EMF is a volunteer effort by a non-profit group, inspired by European and US hacker camps like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Camp">CCC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_at_Random">HAR</a>, and <a href="http://www.toorcamp.org/">toorcamp</a>.
</p>

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Friday 31st August - Sunday 2nd September 2012.</p>

<p>Events and activities will run throughout the day and into the evening, everything else (chats, debates, impromptu circus performances) will run as long as your collective energy lasts.</p>

<h2>Where?</h2>
