# Food & Drink
Don’t forget to eat and drink - hunger and dehydration are the enemies of having a great time!

## Food
We have a great range of food vendors with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Doing a [volunteer shift](/volunteer/info) will allow you to enjoy a meal cooked by our excellent crew catering!

### Vendors

* [Cantina El Burrito](https://www.cantina-elburrito.co.uk/) - Tasty Mexican burritos, nachos and chilli.
* [Colombo Street](https://www.colombostreet.co.uk/foodtruck) - Award Winning Sri Lankan street food.

### Bringing Your Own Food
You are welcome to bring your own food and drink if you'd prefer. Please keep in mind that no open fires are allowed on the grass. If you can, please avoid bringing glass containers - broken glass is a pain to clear up.

There'll be a shop on site offering a range of camping friendly food and drink, and if you need a larger resupply there's a Tesco in Ledbury, which is a five minute drive away, and easily accessible via the shuttle bus.

## Drink
The bars accept cards, cash, and contactless payments. You can check the opening hours and see what the bar is currently serving by visiting [bar.emf.camp](https://bar.emf.camp).

This year we’ve eliminated single-use plastic cups, but we need you to help us return the reusable cups before the end of the event. Please do not throw them away!

Both bars are entirely run by volunteers, and any surplus is reinvested back into the event. If you’d like to help out, visit the [volunteering section of the EMF website](/volunteer/info). There’s a short online training course to complete before you can sign up for bar shifts (18+ only).

### The Robot Arms
Our pub, the Robot Arms, is northwest of Stage B. It sells a wide selection of soft drinks, wine, cider, spirits, and beer. We also have chilled tap water available for you to fill your own bottles.

### Cybar
The solarpunks have taken over Null Sector’s Cybar and are now serving draught beers, soft drinks and even water we think they tapped from an underground pipe.
