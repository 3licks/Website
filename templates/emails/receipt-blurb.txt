We've attached {% if already_emailed %}an updated{% else %}a{% endif %} PDF to this email. Admissions tickets can be shown
on your phone, but we recommend you print them out for convenience.

{% if payment %}
If you have bought a ticket for someone else, you can send it to them
by logging in and clicking 'transfer' beside the relevant ticket. This
will also let them favourite talks on the website and easily sign up
to volunteer:

  {{ external_url('users.purchases') }}

{% endif %}
If you're coming by car and you don't have a parking ticket, you'll
need to buy one before you arrive:

  {{ external_url('tickets.main', flow='other') }}

Any parking tickets must be printed and displayed on your dashboard.

If you're travelling by public transport, we will be running shuttle
buses between a local train station and the festival site.

For more details about how to get to EMF, including shuttle bus times
and driving directions, please see our travel information:

And lastly, EMF is entirely volunteer-run. Please consider
contributing a few hours of your time at the festival to help the
event run smoothly. {% if feature_enabled("VOLUNTEERS_SIGNUP") %} You can register your interest here:
