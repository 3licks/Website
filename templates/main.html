    <h2>Electromagnetic Wave</h2>
    <p>If you can't wait for EMF 2014, the team are running a one-day event in London on May 5th called <a href="/wave">Electromagnetic Wave</a>.</p>
  </div>

<div class="well well-large">
  <h2>Thank You.</h2>
  <p class="summary">Electromagnetic Field 2012 is now finished. We'd like to extend massive thanks to our dedicated organising team,
  everyone who volunteered during the event, and indeed everyone who came. On Saturday we unexpectedly sold out our entire 499 capacity.</p>

  <p>We'd also like to thank everyone for their patience in dealing with the teething troubles we experienced when
    running our first event. We're taking all <a href="http://wiki-archive.emfcamp.org/2012/wiki/Feedback">your feedback</a>
    on board for our next event.</p>

  <p><b><a href="http://wiki-archive.emfcamp.org/2012/wiki/EMF2012_Video">Videos</a> for alpha stage are now online!</b> The recordings from beta will be up soon. There's also a <a href="http://wiki-archive.emfcamp.org/2012/wiki/Documentation">wiki page</a> dedicated to collecting as much documentation of the event as possible. If you have your own photos, videos, recordings, interactive flash games: add them!</p>

  <p>EMF will return, bigger and better, in summer 2014. We run this event in our spare time as volunteers &mdash;
  we all have day jobs &mdash; so for the sake of our blood pressure we can't run the event every year.
  Many of our organising team will also be helping out with the next of the four-yearly Dutch hacker camps,
  <a href="https://ohm2013.org">OHM 2013</a>, and we hope to have a village there. We'd love it if you joined us.</p>
</div>

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>
Electromagnetic Field is a three-day UK camping festival for people with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, geeks, scientists, engineers, artists, and crafters.</p>

<p>There will be people <a href="/talks">talking about everything</a> from <b>genetic modification</b> to <b>electronics</b>, <b>blacksmithing</b> to <b>high-energy physics</b>, <b>reverse engineering</b> to <b>lock picking</b>, <b>crocheting</b> to <b>carpentry</b>, and <b>quadcopters</b> to <b>beer brewing</b>. If you want to talk, there'll be <a href="http://wiki-archive.emfcamp.org/2012/wiki/Talks">space for you to do so</a>, and plenty of people who will want to listen.</p>

<h2>Tell me more!</h2>

<p>Aside from the <a href="/talks">organised talks and workshops</a>, attendees are forming <a href="http://wiki-archive.emfcamp.org/2012/wiki/Villages">villages</a> and planning events of their own, day and night. Wander between tents and you might come across someone teaching safecracking, or accidentally stumble into a late-night jam session using instruments constructed from circuit boards and glowing wire. If you decide to come with friends, maybe you should <a href="http://wiki-archive.emfcamp.org/2012/wiki/Villages">host something of your own</a>!</p>

<p>The camp will be littered with interesting things to play with and explore; extraordinary vehicles and glowing objects can be found in every corner. No matter what your skill level is, there will always be something to do and someone to talk to at the bar.</p>

<p>As well as the usual camp facilities like hot showers and running water, we're also providing power to every tent, and <a href="http://blog.emfcamp.org/post/27143646219/emf-camp-the-site-and-networking">very fast internet access</a>, both wired and wireless.</p>

<p>EMF is a volunteer effort by a non-profit group, inspired by European and US hacker camps like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Camp">CCC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_at_Random">HAR</a>, and <a href="http://www.toorcamp.org/">toorcamp</a>.
</p>

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Friday <b>31st August</b> - Sunday <b>2nd September</b> 2012.</p>

<p>Events and activities will run throughout the day and into the evening, everything else (chats, debates, impromptu circus performances, orbital laser launches) will run as long as your collective energy lasts.</p>

<h2>Where?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=52.061&amp;lon=-0.710&amp;zoom=16">Pineham Park</a>, Milton Keynes, MK15 9LZ, UK.</p>

<p>Milton Keynes has great transport links to the rest of the UK and Europe. It's only 40 minutes on the train from London, and the site is easily accessible from the M1 motorway.</p>
<h2>Help us out</h2>
<p><a href="http://wiki-archive.emfcamp.org/2012/wiki/Talks">Talk and workshop submissions</a> will be open right up to the event, and even during it.</p>
<p>EMF is run entirely by volunteers like you. If you want to help us out
(whether with admin, setup, stewarding, working at the bar, or whatever else) please <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">get in touch</a>.</p>
