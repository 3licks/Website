Hi {{ payment.user.name }},

We've received notification that your payment for {{ payment.amount | price(payment.currency) }} has failed.

{% if payment.purchases | count > 1 %}
We've kept your reservations for now, but they will expire in a few
days if not paid for.
{% else %}
We've kept your reservation for now, but it will expire in a few
days if not paid for.
{% endif %}

If you don't want the purchases you can ignore this email. Otherwise,
you can go to the EMF website:

  {{ external_url('users.purchases') }}

and complete the payment process again.

Love,

All the EMF team
