Hi {{ user.name }},

Just to let you know your EMF {{ proposal.human_type }} "{{ proposal.title}}" is still up for selection, but was not chosen in today's batch.

To be very clear: your submission has NOT been rejected yet!

There's still plenty of time for your {{ proposal.human_type }} to be chosen, and we'll be in touch to let you know for certain in the next three weeks.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in contact:

Thanks,
