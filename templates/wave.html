        <p class="summary">Electromagnetic Wave is a day filled with talks and workshops for those with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things, held on a converted East German fishing vessel moored in London. Brought to you by the non-profit group behind last year's <a href="/">Electromagnetic Field</a> festival, this is a maritime-themed taste of what's to come at the next <abbr title="Electromagnetic Field">EMF</abbr> in 2014.</p>
        <p>Last year at EMF we heard <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/emfcamp/schedule/">talks</a> spanning subjects from <strong>genetic modification</strong> to <strong>electronics</strong>, <strong>blacksmithing</strong> to <strong>high-energy physics</strong>, <strong>reverse engineering</strong> to <strong>lock picking</strong>, <strong>crocheting</strong> to <strong>computer security</strong>, and <strong>drones</strong> to <strong>lolcats</strong>. Electromagnetic Wave will cover similar territory, but the talks have yet to be finalised; submit a presentation and you could find yourself on stage in the cargo hold!</p>


        <p>We're commandeering the fantastic <a href="http://ms.stubnitz.com">Motorschiff Stubnitz</a> for the day: once the pride of the East German deep-sea fishing fleet, she's been converted and now sails around Europe as an atmospheric venue. We're planning on installing a reprise of the fast and reliable WiFi connection at EMF, as well as stocking the Stubnitz's three bars with the best local beers at reasonable prices.</p>

<h2>When?</h2>

<p><strong>Sunday May 5th</strong> (a bank holiday weekend). Talks will run from midday until early evening, and we're planning entertainment aboard the Stubnitz late into the night. Impromptu side-events are likely to occur all weekend.</p>

<h2>Where?</h2>

<p><strong>MS Stubnitz, Wood Wharf, Canary Wharf, London, E14 9SB</strong> (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2uaIV">Google map</a>).</p>

<p>The Stubnitz is five minutes' walk from Canary Wharf station (Jubilee Line or DLR), and parking is available nearby.</p>

<h2>How do I get a ticket?</h2>

<p>Tickets will cost between £20 and £30, and will go on sale soon. To be notified when they go on sale, <a href="http://twitter.com/emw">follow us on Twitter</a> or enter your email address here (we'll only use it for contacting you about Electromagnetic Wave):</p>

<form method="post" action="/wave" class="form-inline">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="text" name="email" class="input-small" style="width:20em" placeholder="email">
    <button type="submit" class="btn">Subscribe to Updates</button>
  </fieldset>
</form>

<p>All proceeds from Electromagnetic Wave will be split between keeping our amazing venue afloat and helping us get next year's Electromagnetic Field on the road; both Stubnitz and EMF are non-profit organisations.</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>Talk and workshop submissions will be opening shortly - we have a limited number of slots and accepted talks will be notified well in advance. The talk selection process will be documented publicly for comment.</p>

<p>If you'd like to bring something to show off, we have space both aboard the ship and ashore. Get in touch to see if we can accomodate you.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic Wave is run entirely by volunteers like you. If you want to help us out (whether with admin, setup, stewarding, working at the bar, or whatever else) please <a href="mailto:contact@emfcamp.org">get in touch</a>.</p>
