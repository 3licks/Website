The groups will think about where we might see differences in weather readings across the EMF site and then deploy the stations around the site to test their ideas over the course of the rest of the festival.\r\nWe also plan to automate the data feed from each station so that we can get hourly updates to twitter from different parts of the festival.

Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We're going to build two switch-mode power supplies (one step-up, one step-down) using tiny SMD parts. They're going to work. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW?
