Hi {{ proposal.user.name }},

We need some final information about your {{ proposal.type }} '{{ proposal.title }}'.

You have been allocated a {{ proposal.scheduled_duration }} minute slot - if this isn't suitable, please get in touch with us immediately. Please note that while you are allowed on-stage Q&A, we would prefer it if you told the audience to meet you somewhere after to discuss it.

You should now finalise the details for your {{ proposal.type }} on our website. Most importantly you can tell us when you're available so that we don't accidentally schedule you for a time when you're not around!

Don't worry, you'll be able to update your {{ proposal.type }} title and description all the way up to the event - just make sure you set your availability now.

To summarise, we urgently need you to:

* Let us know if a {{ proposal.scheduled_duration }} minute slot isn't suitable.
* Fill in the form with your availability so we can schedule you.

And less urgently:

* Write a great description of your {{ proposal.type }} we can publish in the schedule!

Looking forward to seeing you in the field,
All the EMF team
