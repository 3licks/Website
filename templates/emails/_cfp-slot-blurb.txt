If you'd like to share this with people, the public link to your {{ proposal.human_type }} is: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/{{ event_year }}/{{ proposal.id }}

Things to note:

* If you have special requirements and have not spoken to our Green Room team about them, please let them know as soon as possible via: {{ external_url('cfp.proposal_messages', proposal_id=proposal.id) }}
* Any device you're wanting to connect to our projectors must have an HDMI female socket. If it does not, you will need to bring an adaptor that works with your device.
{%- if proposal.type == 'talk' %}
* If you're intending to bring any equipment on stage or conduct any demonstrations during your {{ proposal.human_type }}, you must let us know in advance. 
* Please report to the Green Room 30 minutes before your {{ proposal.human_type }} so that the team can make sure everything is ready for you, and your {{ proposal.human_type }} will go as smoothly as possible!
{%- endif %}
{%- if proposal.type == 'workshop' %}
* Please head to the workshop venue 30 minutes before your session is due to start, so you can set everything up, and the team there can sort out the furniture and AV kit as needed for your workshop.
{%- endif %}

* It is possible that we may have to reschedule your {{ proposal.human_type }} before the event starts, so please make sure you've updated your availability:

  {{ external_url('cfp.finalise_proposal', proposal_id=proposal.id) }}

* You can also update your {{ proposal.human_type }} title and description at any time using the link above, so make sure it sounds great!

{% if proposal.type == 'talk' -%}
* We do not have onstage Q&A at EMF - these are hard for us to manage and frequently unproductive.

  If you'd like to continue the discussion after your talk, the Herald will invite attendees to meet you at the dedicated Q&A tent - located near the lounge - or an alternative venue such as your village or the bar.
{%- endif %}


Looking forward to seeing you in the field,
The EMF Green Room Team
