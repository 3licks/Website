# Volunteer Roles

It takes a wide variety of skills to make EMF happen, it's not all network cabling and designing badges. Ahead of the event, a lot of what needs doing is sending emails and project management. If you've got some spare time and would like to help please do [get in touch](mailto:volunteer@emfcamp.org).

In general we're looking for people ahead of the event who are comfortable with some of the following skills:

* Project management
* Supplier management & ordering
* Stage design & production
* Logistics
* Community outreach
* Graphic design
* Web development

We're also looking for people to fill the following specific roles:

## Music Team

The music team are looking for people to book artists to play, and to look after them once they arrive on site. An interest in music and the ability to remove brown M&Ms are a great help.

## Furniture Wrangler

We need someone to look after all the furniture that gets ordered, counting it off vehicles when it arrives to check we got what we ordered, arranging distribution around the site, and then checking it all back in at the end of the event. No experience needed, but you will need to be on site a few days before the event starts, and leave a few days after.

## Conduct Team

We're looking for people to join the conduct team, which is responsible for enforcing our [code of conduct](https://emfcamp.org/code-of-conduct). We need people who can respond quickly to issues during the event, with a small amount of work involved in handling issues before and after the event.

As this is a sensitive role, we're looking for people who are trusted among EMF attendees or similar communities.

## NullSector Production Manager

In the months ahead of the event NullSector need someone to help with administration, supplier management, placing orders, and scheduling. Some knowledge of set construction, staging, and shipping containers would be very helpful.

# Calls for help

Occasionally we'd like to put out a call for help with specific roles. While we'd love to do that with a giant EMF logo beamed into the night sky, we had to settle for a mailing list instead.
