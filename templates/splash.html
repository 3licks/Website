          Electromagnetic Field is a non-profit UK camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind or an
          interest in making things: hackers, artists, geeks, crafters, scientists, and engineers.
        </p>
        <p>In August 2014 over a thousand people descended on an internet-connected field for
        three days of talks, performances,
        and workshops covering everything from <strong>blacksmithing</strong> to <strong>biometrics</strong>,
        <strong>chiptunes</strong> to <strong>computer security</strong>,
        <strong>high altitude ballooning</strong> to <strong>lockpicking</strong>,
        <strong>origami</strong> to <strong>democracy</strong>,
        and <strong>online privacy</strong> to <strong>knitting</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>We also equipped the field with <strong>fast internet</strong>,
           <strong>power to the tent</strong>, <strong>good beer</strong>, and
          <strong>amazing installations</strong>.
