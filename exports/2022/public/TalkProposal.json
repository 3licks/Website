During various Covid-19 lockdowns, I decided to re-enact this important development in the history of computing, through a project to build an Enigma machine at home, using modern components and digital design techniques. The completed project is made out of cheap hobby electronics parts and laser-cut wood, and can be assembled entirely by hand, with no gluing, screwing or soldering. I will reflect on what this process taught me about the challenges of electromechanical computing, security and usability, the changes in modern manufacturing and supply chains, and their impact on computing. This will be followed by a Q&A and a demonstration where you can see the home-made Enigma machine in action and have a go at encrypting and decrypting a message.\"",

I recommend it to everyone! In this talk I'll show some of the highlights of the journey, and what to expect if you embark on it yourself.",

A major barrier is that they are very expensive at thousands of pounds each and built to order with lead times of over a year. Rather like bagpipes, they are loud. For pipers, practice e-chanters are available while nothing similar exists for the hurdy-gurdy. The Digi-Gurdy project started as a 3D printed version of the keyboard part of the instrument in isolation, with some internal electronics, for my own personal use to learn a few tunes on. After posting on Thingiverse, a website for sharing 3D printed ideas, I had many requests from people asking me to build them one. This open-source project has developed through many variations which I would bring to the talk, resulting in an all laser-cut wooden full-size hurdy gurdy design with a realistic crank handle system and a detachable playable keybox for travelling. It is an electronic device, with correctly placed keys, that outputs data via the industry standard MIDI communications system for electronic musical instruments, via a USB cable to an attached or wirelessly paired phone or iPad running suitable MIDI player software. It is a low-cost way to enter the Hurdy Gurdy world and allows practice anywhere using headphones, thus preventing eviction or divorce!",

Thus began a decade of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almost totally forgotten in Britain. \r\n\r\nBetween 1940\u20131950, the British Council produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain covering sports, manufacturing, landscapes, art, architecture, public healthcare, the justice system, democratic process, public institutions like the National Trust and the BBC, and more besides. \r\nA far cry from the Ministry of Information's rigid style, this collection features some of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (2001: A Space Odyssey, Cabaret, Superman), and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes). \r\n\r\nDistributed to over 100 countries worldwide, the films are stunning, dated, funny, and bizarre by turn. They depict beautiful countrysides, optimistic cities, strong industry, forward-thinking social structures, and hardworking, happy people. They depict exactly the popular image of 1940s Britain that persists to this day... \r\nThat may not be a coincidence. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll cover the history and development of this film collection, how it was shaped, who saw the films, their staggering success, and their untold global legacy.",

They passed me by\u2026\r\n\r\n In 2014, the v2 software was open sourced - the inevitable precursor to failure - and the company bought by Drone/Robotics developer for the obvious design skills of the Sifteo team; they had, after all, reverse engineered and reapplied wireless keyboard controllers into one of the coolest toys ever! So, I came to them late. Too late. By 2015, the server the control software required, along with the online marketplace for the dozen or so games that were made, were long gone. The Sifteo cubes I\u2019d just (re)discovered from a desperate eBay sale were now just useless, battery powered bricks. And they didn\u2019t even click together!\r\n\r\nBut I was stubborn.

Eventually, the railway companies learned the benefits of adopting safer methods of working (sometimes requiring some encouragement from the law), leading to the introduction of some Victorian methods we still use today. Finally, we look at the more modern era with the railway losing its way with privatisation, and onto the current time, where computers and paperwork solve everything.

To hold these digital \"conversations\" with microbes, ALICE uses the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) as a communications platform. MFCs are an organic energy source powered by microbes which facilitate contact between humans and microbes through electrical exchanges. The collected and analysed data can tell us about household resources, as microbes can give us information about our consumption, and reveal what we discard in our waste streams\u2014while also powering our homes and, ultimately, cities.\r\n\r\nhttps://alice-interface.eu\r\n\r\nCome and see us in Null Sector!",

After working on container ships as an engineer in the mid-2000s, it seemed every more unlikely. We didn't have a full-time Internet connection and all the vital systems were truly air-gapped. But things have changed - ships are becoming more and more connected and complex. \r\n\r\nAs a result, 15 years later, I found myself sat in my pants on the sofa with the ability to control the steering on one of the world's largest cruise ships. We've been able to brick every PLC across tens of oil rigs, pay for food as the captain, and write rude words on the side of the ship. \r\n\r\nTo get to this point, we had to go on a learning voyage across tens of different vessels, including offshore support tugs, super yachts, oil rigs and container ships. Join me on a whistle stop tour of what's on a ship, how it's all connected together, what threats there are and how we find the vulnerabilities. Lots of little tips and tricks that can help anyone examine industrial control systems, understand how they work, and then have a lot of fun with them!\r\n\r\nTesting work is carried out in my role as Security Consultant at Pen Test Partners",

Live coding is just another way of making music and other time-based artforms like video and choreography.\r\nSo this talk is about the _past_ of live coding, rather than the future -- we'll look at algorithmic artforms developed over millennia. Weaving and braiding are classic examples, highly developed algorithmic crafts found all round the world, reaching astonishing complexity. We'll also look 'heritage algorithms' like bell ringing patterns, juggling patterns, konnakol vocal patterns, and kollam drawings, and equivalent contemporary practices like bytebeat, bitfield and tidalcycles patterns.\r\nIn the end we'll ask, what do we gain from seeing the latter in terms of the former? In particular, what do contemporary 'digital' artists have to learn from craft-based heritage algorithmic artforms?\r\n",

The invention of mechanical and electrical computing devices in the 19th and 20th centuries by pioneers such as Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing allowed such problems to be solved both more cheaply and more reliably. Nowadays, computers are immensely more powerful than they were in either Babbage\u2019s or Turing\u2019s time. We will describe a few mathematical problems that computers can solve, and present some of the key techniques, such as step-by-step iteration, recursion and Monte-Carlo simulation. We touch upon some modern computing tools, such as calculators, spreadsheets, programming languages etc. These tools are the present-day equivalents of Babbage\u2019s and Turing\u2019s machines, and are available to us all (often for free) in order to solve our everyday mathematical problems in work and in life.

I will break down how harmful neoliberal methodologies that dominate tech groupthink such as Human Centered Design and Design Thinking fundamentally restrict what can be made whilst presenting a cardboard cutout \u201cethics\u201d that falls over at the slightest touch.\r\n\r\nInstead I introduce Community Technology Partnerships, a methodology developed at Geeks for Social change in collaboration with Manchester School of Architecture, based on \u201cthe capability approach\u201d. This is a human development approach used by the UN and WHO developed by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen that asks what people are able to *be* and *do,* and works to remove blockers to these concrete actions and states. This approach recentres community strengths at the centre of more holistic tech interventions that restore power to the people who need it the most.\r\n\r\nNotes for this talk are here: https://gfsc.studio/emf22\r\n",

As a blind person, I do this every day; this is your opportunity to learn how to use sensory input that you already have, but you simply don\u2019t realize or pay attention to.\r\n\r\nThis is specifically focused on blind navigation and sensory experience. I'll also (briefly) cover how and how not to interact with a blind person on the street, cognitive shifts from perceiving the world as a blind person, real vs myth difficulties, etc., but not blindness 101, braille, computers, general life skills, medical/legal issues, or the like.\r\n\r\nCome in person. This isn't just a talk; in the live audience, you'll directly experience how to use senses you don't know you have, with participatory demonstrations tailored to the physical environment of EMF Camp, based on the skills and stimuli relied on every day by blind people like me. Practice during camp, and you'll sense more \u2014 permanently.\r\n\r\nYou'll have a better experience if you wear short sleeves, have your hair uncovered, and come together with someone with whom you're comfortable exchanging brief touch on the cheek, neck, or arm.\r\n\r\nI will be completely blindfolded for the entire talk. I won't see you nod, shake your head, wave, or the like. Although I might be able to detect that if we're talking one-on-one, I can't do so when you're in a crowd or at stage distance. I still rely on live audience feedback, so please respond audibly, e.g. with words or clapping.\r\n\r\nPer EMF request, there's no Q&A during talk. Just follow me outside afterwards if you have questions or comments, or join one of the workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Workshops\r\n\r\nI'll run hands-on workshops each day. By going for a walk with me around the camp \u2014 blindfolded, using one of my guide canes \u2014 you'll gain qualitative experience you can't get anywhere else. \r\n\r\nSignup is now open: https://s.ai/emf/ws\r\n\r\n# Volunteers needed\r\n\r\nI'll need assistants during the talk (on and off stage).

Whether it's for usability, profit, safety, profit or 'sparking joy', or profit (it's usually profit), 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s.
