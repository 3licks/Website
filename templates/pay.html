<p>We don't have a final budget yet, so we're currently only letting people
    put a deposit down for their ticket.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deposit pre-sales cost <strong>£30</strong> per ticket.</li>
    <li>They will entitle you to pay the rest of your ticket price at a £5 discount to the full price.</li>
    <li>We anticipate the full ticket price to be between £75 to £95.
        If the final ticket price is within this range, you'll have to pay a £10
        administration fee if you want a refund of your deposit.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Taking credit card payments for a small event like us is really expensive, so the only
payment methods we accept are by bank transfer. If this is really a problem for you, please
<a href="mailto:tickets@emfcamp.org">let us know</a>.

<p>If you want to pay in Euros, we're working on it. Email tickets@emfcamp.org and we'll let
you know when our Euro bank account is ready.</p>
