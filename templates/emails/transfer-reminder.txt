Hello {{ user.name }}!

You've currently got more than one adult EMF ticket registered against
your email address.

We'd really appreciate you transferring the tickets for others to their
email addresses so we can send them information as the event approaches.

When you arrive at the event we may also ask for your email address or
ID at check-in, so it is important that each ticket be registered to
the correct person.

Don't worry, tickets can be transferred again if people need to sell
them on!

You can find all the tickets registered to your account on the
following page, along with a "transfer" button:

Looking forward to seeing you all in the field,
The EMF team
