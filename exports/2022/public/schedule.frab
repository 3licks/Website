Often we unconsciously follow bad protocols: Who doesn't know the situation where the loudest/most eloquent/charismatic person gets to dominate the conversation or the HIPPO effect. Or we have battles of two opponents/opinions, with the rest of the group watching in terror or shutting off. How about that awkward silence in a big group where nobody wants to go first, the terror of going in a circle and being expected to be able to contribute at just that moment when it is your turn? &#13;
&#13;
There is a better way, and it is easy and fun.&#13;
&#13;
In this highly interactive workshop, y'all get to experience and practice simple recipes for structuring interactions that include and involve everyone. &#13;
&#13;
Come as you are and experience some intercation. Or learn more about the principles and micro structures for these "group interaction recipes" at liberatingstructures.com.&#13;

&#13;
In those days, human 'computers' were used to calculate and tabulate the solutions to maths problems ranging from trigs and logs, to astronomical, nautical, banking and insurance information etc. However, those human computing processes were laborious (thus expensive), and error-prone. The invention of mechanical and electrical computing devices in the 19th and 20th centuries by pioneers such as Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing allowed such problems to be solved both more cheaply and more reliably. Nowadays, computers are immensely more powerful than they were in either Babbage&#8217;s or Turing&#8217;s time. We will describe a few mathematical problems that computers can solve, and present some of the key techniques, such as step-by-step iteration, recursion and Monte-Carlo simulation. We touch upon some modern computing tools, such as calculators, spreadsheets, programming languages etc. These tools are the present-day equivalents of Babbage&#8217;s and Turing&#8217;s machines, and are available to us all (often for free) in order to solve our everyday mathematical problems in work and in life. We end the talk by briefly speculating upon whether computing has anything to say about the nature of our lives and of the universe itself.&#13;

Others love books, but may not consider themselves "real collectors" because they don't fit the image presented in popular culture. &#13;
&#13;
In this talk I'll go beyond the typical arguments for books ("they smell good", "they're pleasurable to handle") and discuss the more complex reasons old books matter, primarily how collecting them can inform scholarship and change the way we see the world. I&#8217;ll present examples of real book collections that ask and answer important social and historical questions; challenge the idea that book collecting is only for wealthy people who want to acquire status symbols; and provide practical advice on how to go from book buyer to book collector.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-107-fill-your-home-with-obsolete-technology</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="868">Laura Massey</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="116" guid="9e2126c8-8315-52b1-9939-b45535f3d617"><room>Stage B</room><title>Why do researchers get 'hackers' so wrong, and why we should be worried about the police's response?</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T12:20:00+01:00</date><start>12:20</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>In this presentation, two criminologists and one sociologist reflect on why criminology and sociology often get &#8216;hacking&#8217; very wrong - and on the challenges we faced trying to get it (a bit more) right. &#13;
&#13;
We draw on ongoing research into how involvement in hacking practices changes over people&#8217;s lives, understanding moves between legal and illegal practices, often occupying all the grey areas in between. This talk is part take-down of previous criminological research into hacking, part navel-gaze into the difficulties of defining &#8216;hacking&#8217;, part critique of computer misuse legislation and policing practices like PREVENT, and part moan about institutional barriers to doing hacking research well.&#13;

Early works include pieces by pioneering artists Vera Moln&#225;r, Frieder Nake and Manfred Mohr, who first developed algorithms with independent creative intent, and laid the foundations for today&#8217;s digital art practices.  &#13;
&#13;
Over time, as the use of computers has increased and society has become networked, the collection has grown to include artists working at the forefront of technological innovation. Artists featured include David Em, who in 1977, produced navigable virtual worlds whilst working with scientists at NASA, and moving to the 21st century, Nye Thompson who interrogates global surveillance systems and their influence on machine vision.   &#13;
&#13;
Join us for a curator talk of the collection, exploring iconic digital works that expand on the relationships between art, technology and everyday life. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-209-computer-art-from-the-1960s-until-now</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1677">Pita Arreola</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="213" guid="46e6b92a-efe9-5624-aec5-58f942012eab"><room>Stage B</room><title>Algorithmic patterns - a long history</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T13:40:00+01:00</date><start>13:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Creative coding practices like live coding/algorave are often described by the media as being of the future. For example in 2019, wired magazine introduced live coding with the headline &#8220;DJs of the future don&#8217;t spin records, they write code&#8221;, despite publishing very similar articles previously in 2013 (&#8220;Hacking meets clubbing with the Algorave&#8221;) and 2006 (&#8220;Real DJs Code Live&#8221;). In reality, live coders are not DJs and are not trying to replace them! Live coding is just another way of making music and other time-based artforms like video and choreography.&#13;
So this talk is about the _past_ of live coding, rather than the future -- we'll look at algorithmic artforms developed over millennia. Weaving and braiding are classic examples, highly developed algorithmic crafts found all round the world, reaching astonishing complexity. We'll also look 'heritage algorithms' like bell ringing patterns, juggling patterns, konnakol vocal patterns, and kollam drawings, and equivalent contemporary practices like bytebeat, bitfield and tidalcycles patterns.&#13;
In the end we'll ask, what do we gain from seeing the latter in terms of the former? In particular, what do contemporary 'digital' artists have to learn from craft-based heritage algorithmic artforms?&#13;

This machine is  unique  in many respects:&#13;
 - It is the most powerful microscope, which can  probe the  distance one million times smaller than the size of the proton&#13;
 - It can reproduce conditions of the hot Early Universe with the temperature billion times higher than in the core of the sun, corresponding  to  a picosecond after the Big Bang&#13;
&#13;
This uniqueness gives the LHC opportunity to resolve  the biggest puzzles of the Universe:&#13;
 - to find the origin of Matter-Antimatter asymmetry &#8211;  the origin of planets and starts&#13;
 - to Shed a light on the origin of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, 95% of which  the Universe is &#13;
    made of (stars and planets contribute only 5% to it !)&#13;
 - to give us the answer on what is the ultimate theory which drives this Universe &#8211; at micro and &#13;
   macro scales.&#13;
&#13;
In the presentation I will explain the exciting details of the Large Hadron Collider and how it helps to solve the most challenging problems of particle physics and cosmology &#8211; from micro to macro scales.&#13;

PAMAL_Group creates its own works from digital artworks that have disappeared or been severely damaged due to the obsolescence of computer software and hardware. Its work seeks to reveal the vulnerability of an art that is highly dependent on industrial logic. All the artworks that the collective reconstructs, as close as possible to the original materialities, sometimes in a deficient way, are treated as archives.&#13;

The artwork "3615 Love" is based on the reconstruction of telematic materialities (videotex, Minitel network, etc.) and the archive of works by Jacques-Elie Chabert and Camille Philibert (L'Objet perdu, 1985) and Eduardo Kac (Videotext Poems, 1985-1986). The installation "3615 Love" shows how fragile and vulnerable our digital environment - and a fortiori its artistic productions - is. &#13;

I like making things, often mechanical or electronic. My sculptures frequently have audio elements, and involve owls whenever possible.&#13;
&#13;
My website has a lot of descriptions of how projects were built, but I'm planning a talk that gives a little more detail about the business side of making things full time for a living. The talk is aimed at myself, 20 years ago.&#13;

&#13;
Covering the very basics of digital audio, microcontrollers, audio codecs and PCB design, this talk will give a whistle stop tour of the process involved in making digital effects processors from conception to building a prototype. This talk will be aimed at those with little experience, but an interest in combining electronics and programming to process live audio in hardware.&#13;
&#13;
I came from a programming background, and have no training in electronics. I want to show an audience what can be achieved with a little bit of knowledge and lots of enthusiasm. Encouraging borrowing from open source projects to identify common circuits and practises that can be stitched together to form a complete project.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-40-an-introduction-to-building-your-own-digital-audio-effects</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="561">Cutlasses (Scott Pitkethly)</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="124" guid="e805e2a4-2d83-5008-93df-cc91119c6291"><room>Stage B</room><title>Running around in circles and why it isn't as useless as you first expect.</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T17:00:00+01:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>I run Parkrun (some weeks), and am trying to run the alphabet.

&#13;
In this talk I will explore the broad and interesting idea of Topology and present them to a general audience through comedy and one of my other main passions, parkrun.

&#13;
He&#8217;s a multi disciplinary artist with exhibitions of his work under his belt as well as many live shows; from squat raves in Berlin to Warehouse setups in London.&#13;
&#13;
You might have seen some of his inventions floating around the internet, from organs made from 80's Furby toys, Bikes that have Synthesisers and drum machines built into them to 5000 Volt Jacobs ladder and Tesla coil Drum machines, all the way over to Flamethrower organs.

Follow the omnipotent Creator on his pilgrimage through distant reaches of an alternate polyhedral universe, occupied by psychedelic soundscapes, rhythmical acid entities and uncharted electro artefacts.&#13;
&#13;
POLYOP have developed their live show alongside their own open-source visual performance engine 'Hedron'. Their sound fuses the DNA of funk, and electro with techno and modern sound design; whilst the visuals combine sci-fi aesthetics with polyhedral graphics popularised by early 3D graphics engines.&#13;

While he did make an appearance that year, RGB lights dazzling in the dark, our ambitions for autonomy were thwarted.  However, with the arrival of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano in 2019 our artificial intelligence powered rover idea came to life.  After surviving his own brush with Covid-19, and nearly becoming a South African Nurse. Four years on, Geoff is back, and he's living his best life. &#13;

This talk delves into the highs and lows from over 4 and a half years of development: &#13;
Designing a custom Motor Controller, &#13;
Cannibalizing a CCTV pan &amp; tilt unit to build an expressive head and utilising suspension components from an RC car, &#13;
Burning out motors and eating gears, it took some perseverance with a dash of curiosity to get right, &#13;
Driving hundreds of LEDs in amazing patterns, &#13;
Integrating a NVIDIA Jetson Nano (and then Xavier NX), &#13;
His "hunger" for Oranges, &#13;
Nearly becoming a robotic nurse in South Africa Covid-19 wards, &#13;
Complete redesign of electrical systems, &#13;
Increasing capability with new sensors and 4 wheel steering drivetrain, &#13;
Developing software across different systems, including FreeRTOS, ROS, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Arduino, AWS Sagemaker and more&#8230; </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-147-the-life-of-geoff</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="982">Lincoln &amp; Chris Barnes (Team Robotmad)</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="335" guid="5ea35121-4107-538b-9df7-e9be439823fa"><room>Stage C</room><title>Product Launch: Chocolate Synthbox Sound synthesizer </title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T15:10:00+01:00</date><start>15:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>It's not every day that you get the chance to attend the unveiling of a device that will change the face of music as we know it.

&#13;
There's no need for any prior programming or hardware experience.

The talk would be centred around the video - but also a chance for a Q&amp;A, some description of how I ended up with an SEM, and/or presentation on SEM technology and/or refurbishing the device.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-97-refurbishing-a-1970s-scanning-electron-microscope-sem</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="863">Andy Whyte, Jason Evans</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="363" guid="1f33632d-aee0-5221-b0a8-c332e2253311"><room>Stage C</room><title>From Parsnips to Palm Trees: the Economics of Stardew Valley</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T16:20:00+01:00</date><start>16:20</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>You're in the big city, working so hard that it's all you know, and when your grandpa leaves you his farm you quit that city life taking all your hard-earned life savings of 500 bucks (about 2 jars of mayonnaise) with you. How you afforded the bus there is questionable.&#13;
&#13;
You start with a handful of seeds and that's 15 bucks profit margin each after the 4 days it takes you to grow them. Seems like a harsh transition, but after a couple of years your enterprising business could somehow be making you millions! No Silicon. Only Valley. &#13;
&#13;
I will try to answer the most important questions such as 'Why is the recipe for espresso worth more than diamonds?' and 'What happens if you apply the model to your real life?'

So the thought occurred. Can I make a live caption display fit into a mask so that she can read what I'm saying?&#13;
&#13;
This talk will cover how to build a wearable LED display, how to build a web app which uses AI to convert speech to text and how to compress that text into a scrolling pixel font to send to the display.&#13;
&#13;
We'll be using Node, JavaScript and some C, Azure Cognitive Services and MQTT.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-260-wearable-live-captions-making-mask-wearing-more-accessible</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="93">Jo Franchetti</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="8" guid="d29bdf02-5359-52c3-939b-c699b4e2d593"><room>Stage C</room><title>Sense without sight: blind navigation for sighted people</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T17:40:00+01:00</date><start>17:40</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>Learn to sense the world without your eyes &#8212; hear walls and corridors, sense doorways and ceilings with your hair, feel nearby walls and people on your skin. (Yes, literally.) As a blind person, I do this every day; this is your opportunity to learn how to use sensory input that you already have, but you simply don&#8217;t realize or pay attention to.&#13;
&#13;
This is specifically focused on blind navigation and sensory experience. I'll also (briefly) cover how and how not to interact with a blind person on the street, cognitive shifts from perceiving the world as a blind person, real vs myth difficulties, etc., but not blindness 101, braille, computers, general life skills, medical/legal issues, or the like.&#13;
&#13;
Come in person. This isn't just a talk; in the live audience, you'll directly experience how to use senses you don't know you have, with participatory demonstrations tailored to the physical environment of EMF Camp, based on the skills and stimuli relied on every day by blind people like me. Practice during camp, and you'll sense more &#8212; permanently.&#13;
&#13;
You'll have a better experience if you wear short sleeves, have your hair uncovered, and come together with someone with whom you're comfortable exchanging brief touch on the cheek, neck, or arm.&#13;
&#13;
I will be completely blindfolded for the entire talk. I won't see you nod, shake your head, wave, or the like. Although I might be able to detect that if we're talking one-on-one, I can't do so when you're in a crowd or at stage distance. I still rely on live audience feedback, so please respond audibly, e.g. with words or clapping.&#13;
&#13;
Per EMF request, there's no Q&amp;A during talk. Just follow me outside afterwards if you have questions or comments, or join one of the workshops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
# Workshops&#13;
&#13;
I'll run hands-on workshops each day. By going for a walk with me around the camp &#8212; blindfolded, using one of my guide canes &#8212; you'll gain qualitative experience you can't get anywhere else. &#13;
&#13;

# Volunteers needed&#13;
&#13;
I'll need assistants during the talk (on and off stage). No experience necessary &#8212; but brief training beforehand is, preferably Thursday (day 0) evening. Especially helpful if you have experience in aikido or similar martial arts, and are willing to be my on-stage uke during the talk.&#13;

&#13;
Along the way we mention some of the key physics-based aspects (orbits, azimuth and elevation, Doppler shift, etc.) and cover themes such as: a) Web-based satellite tracking software, b) Some candidate satellites to track, c) Signal receiving equipment, starting with purely web-software-based receivers, d) Antenna issues, e) Decoding the CW received signal, and finally f) Taking things further with more advanced topics.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-103-receiving-amateur-radio-satellite-beacons</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="866">Damian Bevan</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="369" guid="322a8c5a-ca4b-5cd4-852f-f849c4ac815c"><room>Stage C</room><title>Stage C Fri change over placeholder</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T19:10:00+01:00</date><start>19:10</start><duration>0:10</duration><abstract>placeholder</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-369-stage-c-fri-change-over-placeholder</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1847">Stage C Placeholder</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="382" guid="282b6865-2546-5cd4-9239-4e74709c6d6c"><room>Stage C</room><title>[Film] General Magic</title><type>performance</type><date>2022-06-03T19:30:00+01:00</date><start>19:30</start><duration>1:33</duration><abstract>Friday 19:30 - 1h 33m - 12A&#13;

Geek classic Hackers returns after four years. Legendary hacker Zero Cool and his friends have been framed by The Plague, who has unleashed a computer virus that could cause an environmental disaster. Pursued by the Secret Service, the gang try to gather the evidence to take The Plague down and stop the virus from unleashing havoc. A bumper-fest of hacking, car chases and double-crossing that has become lore in geek culture.

&#13;
We will then move on to a number of short "parables" each exploring an interesting anecdote from my career, and using them to show the inherent conflicts between different sustainability domains. &#13;
&#13;
- Environmental: Bird Poo, trying to convince a customer than sending skips of rubble for incineration "to avoid landfiil" was not in fact environmentally friendly, despite their best efforts to justify this based on the fact it contained some pigeon droppings. &#13;
- Economic: Vibrators, exploring the underlying reasons why my first day working in waste management, comprised having to find a home of 80 oil drums which had been inexplicably filled with sex toys. &#13;
- Social: Chemical Weapons, how running a project to dispose of "orphaned" gas cylinders of Chemical Weapons and Rocket Propellants discovered lurking in a shipping container, gave me a fresh perspective on our duties to each other as human beings.&#13;
&#13;
Depending on run-time we may take in some other (sometimes cryptically named) anecdotes such as:&#13;
&#13;
- Accidentally advising the UN Environment Programme. &#13;
- Arguing with DEFRA as a hobby.&#13;
- Trying to understand the environmental impact of shampoo. &#13;
- "The million pound milk-bottle". &#13;
- "The gas man cometh".&#13;
&#13;

This started as a student / hobby project and is now receiving funding from the European Space Agency (ESA.) There are lots of interesting technical problems involved in making a VTVL rocket work. You need to steer the rocket engine and control its thrust based on data from a variety of sensors. This involves mechanical, electronics and coding challenges. When fully developed, the test vehicle we've developed will be used to test software and hardware that enable robots to land safely on other planets such as Mars.&#13;
&#13;
The talk will start with an introduction to rocket engines and a simple explanation of the vehicle's dynamics then cover the development of our VTVL rocket from hobby project to successful flying test-bed. It will include video footage of recent test flights where the rocket takes off and hovers on a tethered test rig.&#13;

But then, your government disrupts phone coverage in the area to discourage protestors and potentially cover human rights violations.&#13;
Scary, right? Hopefully you're not in this situation. But chances are your hacker brain would love to know how I used tech to react to this! In this talk, I'll cover how we stayed connected using Mesh Networking, phones' Wi-Fi chips, a couple of apps, a bit of fear, and a whole lot of determination!&#13;

They have the same few buttons in the same place.&#13;
&#13;
It doesn't have to be this way. In this talk, I'll go through how I've made controllers that are different and unique.&#13;
&#13;
These controllers are quick and easy to make with a microcontroller and Circuit Python, and theycan use almost any input device, such as slider potentiometers, rotary encoders, IMUs and touch pads. We&#8217;ll look at what&#8217;s worked, what hasn&#8217;t and how to make your own games controller.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-134-building-weird-games-controllers</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1050">ben Everard</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="160" guid="52ae2e47-3f94-56ec-949d-77f3dd99b841"><room>Stage A</room><title>Emotions, what's up with those?</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T17:30:00+01:00</date><start>17:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>About four years ago I realised I was miserable and that I should probably do something about that, so I did what any self-respecting nerd would do and read a tonne of books to figure out how emotions worked (I did also go to therapy, but the books were more useful). Life isn't perfect now, but it's a lot better despite the ongoing war and pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
I'm going to give you an overview of some of the things I've learned. It will be a mix of theory (what even are emotions?) and practical advice for understanding and engaging with your emotions better, with a pointer towards further reading  that will help you act on this advice better.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-160-emotions-whats-up-with-those</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1036">David MacIver</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="140" guid="b5df9eab-bd90-5e1c-aa12-ab8abc7bbb63"><room>Stage A</room><title>Soft Electronics</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T18:10:00+01:00</date><start>18:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>This talk explores the softer side of electronics, from electronic embroidery and e-textiles to soft robotics and flexible PCB design. We will take a look at some of the exciting technologies in this field, including industrial machines that embroider traces to microcontrollers, open source soft robotics, 'pick and place' sewable LEDs, e-textiles in space, fabric speakers and the world of flexible and stretchable PCB design. I will also share examples of how engineers, scientists and artists are using these soft electronics technologies in their work.&#13;
&#13;
As well as this higher level overview, we will take a look at a number of accessible DIY projects, along with practical tips on materials and techniques, and suggestions for further learning. I will also talk about softness in electronics in a non-literal sense, looking at some cool projects from the community that link emotions, vulnerability and physical computing.  </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-140-soft-electronics</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1054">Helen Leigh</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="164" guid="67aa4e07-ff63-57ef-b88b-39e15337ff5b"><room>Stage A</room><title>Ship vs Oil Rig</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-03T18:50:00+01:00</date><start>18:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>When a 3,500 ton ship tries to be in the same place as an oil rig then it is safe to say that someone is going to have a bad day.

I then returned in 2018 to debunk the headline myths and update on what was actually happening on the tech side. &#13;
&#13;
Now it's 2022 and it's been one heck of a ride. That original talk launched two sex tech hackathons, saw the UK host a conference, produced a book, and &#8211; nicest of all &#8211; contributed to the growth of a global community researching these things. There&#8217;s a few new things happening in the arena &#8212; but also very little progress on the hardware front. Why is that? What&#8217;s the actual  likelihood of domestic bliss with a hot machine (other than your toaster) by 2050?

First, we will build our very own "glowie" torch (coincell + LED + tape) to keep, explore the brightness of different colours of LEDs and each attendee will get to pick which colour they want to use for the second stage.&#13;
&#13;
In the second stage of the activity, we will head outside into the dark (or twilight) and take some long exposure light painting photographs. Common things drawn in the past include initials, basic shapes or just simple lines.&#13;

&#13;
Imagine making podcasts that sound different based on what time your listening, where they are and what language is their default. Imagine up to 100+ layers of audio including binaural audio and text to speech to round off a new podcast experience.&#13;
&#13;
This is only the start of what adaptive podcasting can do.&#13;
&#13;
In this 2 part workshop.&#13;
&#13;
Part 1: We will explore what adaptive podcasting is, how it works and what are the possibilities, and a few demos of what has been done so far. There will be lots of time for questions and answers.&#13;
&#13;
Part 2: Will have you experimenting and creating your own podcasts using the web editor and/or directly with code. The results can be shared with others in the camp and the wider community.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-174-the-future-of-podcasting-is-adaptive-open-and-data-ethical</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="2079">Ian Forrester</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="468" guid="efec31d3-a851-5309-9c1e-1b975adca10e"><room>Workshop 5</room><title>Maths Face Painting</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-03T17:00:00+01:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>Come to the Maths Village / Workshop 5 tent to get some maths painted on your face.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-468-maths-face-painting</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="580">The Maths Village</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="469" guid="3f8ff2e8-a2f0-50e9-8c99-02842460e9d7"><room>Workshop 5</room><title>James Arthur Q&amp;A</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-03T17:30:00+01:00</date><start>17:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Following James Arthurs's talk on Stage B, we will be hosting a Q&amp;A session in the Maths Village / Workshop 5 tent.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-469-james-arthur-q-a</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="580">James Arthur</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="467" guid="bfd9043e-b2d5-5561-b9a4-8434bd3ed69f"><room>Workshop 5</room><title>MathsJam</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-03T19:00:00+01:00</date><start>19:00</start><duration>3:00</duration><abstract>On Friday evening, we'll be converting the Maths Village / Workshop 5 tent into a temporary pub, in order to host a MathsJam: an opportunity for like-minded self-confessed maths enthusiasts to get together in a pub and share stuff they like - puzzles, games, problems, or just anything they think is cool or interesting.

If you drop by with a Laptop running Kali-Linux either from USB-Stick or from within a virtual machine, I will walk you through the necessary steps. From analyzing the target system, finding exploits on it on to successfully hacking the "victim" using metasploit. And if you are quick enough and behave, we might even get so far as to remotely crash the system.&#13;
&#13;
This is an introductionary level workshop targeted at a novice/beginner level audience that wants to learn how "hacking" actually works. InfoSec personel and other "professionals" attending this session will get shanghaied into supporting the other attendees. &#13;

Make normal objects clever with the micro:bit</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-03T13:00:00+01:00</date><start>13:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>The world is being shaped by machine learning. In fact, lots of the pages you visit on the internet are curated by algorithms that have learned what you like, or might buy.&#13;
&#13;
But what's actually going on? And how do machines 'learn'?&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop we'll use the BBC micro:bit to make everyday objects that you bring along, or people that you attach a device to, smarter with machine learning. Make a tennis racket that knows whether you've played a forehand or a backhand, or a shoe that knows whether you're walking or running. Or perhaps a device that can detect your dance moves.&#13;
&#13;
By going through the whole process of collecting data, training a model and then testing the model, we'll demystify some of how machine learning works in the real world, and hopefully have some fun throwing micro:bits around doing it.&#13;
&#13;
We're testing some new software for use with the micro:bit, and this is one of our first outings with it. Please come with the spirit of adventure. Families welcome as long as there are some members who are keen to lead the others!&#13;
&#13;
Suitable for children under 8 if helped by an adult.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-291-machine-learning-playtime-make-normal-objects-clever</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="790">Jonny Austin</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="334" guid="6c22461b-69ae-5661-b2d6-e3cb3fcf4344"><room>Workshop 4</room><title>Cyanotype Workshop</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-03T14:30:00+01:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>I am pleased to share my Cyanotype Workshop.&#13;

If any of these are true, (or if you just want to build a robot), come and join us and construct a terrible fighting robot for the Hebocon tournament.&#13;
&#13;
Hebocon is Robot Wars for those who are not technically gifted. The most successful robots are those which are truly &#8216;heboi&#8217;: pathetic, and constructed without the technology or skill that you&#8217;d usually expect.  Bad ideas and poor construction are the mark of success here, so you can create something free from the weight of any expectations.&#13;
&#13;
We'll have some boxes of junk to rummage through for parts, but attendees are encouraged to bring their own materials too, the weirder the better*!&#13;
&#13;
The actual hebocon tournament will be outside the bar on Saturday night at 6pm: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/351-hebocon-terrible-robot-fighting-tournament&#13;

Whether it's coming from space, from radioactive elements in the Earth, or from human activity, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere we go, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is happening all the time, and curiously, some objects in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.&#13;
&#13;
One instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-M&#252;ller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-M&#252;ller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. Attendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-35-build-your-own-geiger-counter</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="549">Yannick</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="92" guid="25749228-3232-5bed-836c-2a261e78eebb"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>LED Strips Everywhere for Everyone!</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-03T22:00:00+01:00</date><start>22:00</start><duration>1:30</duration><abstract>Learn how to program LED strips.&#13;

For total beginners -- no knowledge needed at all.&#13;
&#13;
Full Description&#13;
&#13;
LED strips have become really inexpensive. Lots of people have created inexpensive methods of controlling their color and brightness. This workshop shows one way to control LED strips, and to make them do what you want. We will use a very inexpensive Arduino clone. I'll show you everything you need to know to use existing programs -- as-is, or to hack on -- to control the colors in your world with LED strips.&#13;
&#13;

Try scratching records on a set of Technics SL1210&#8217;s and then get hands on with your own device and learning digital DJ skills and techniques.&#13;
&#13;
We will primarily use Mixxx software for the workshop as it's so awesome as well as being open source and free, but other free options for tablets and phones are all possible. There will also be an opportunity to plug into a USB Mixer/controller and demo your new skills at the end! The ultimate aim of this workshop is to introduce some basics of DJ'ing. The kids also have the exciting option to DJ at their own Kids Disco later in the evening at 7:30pm!  Royalty free music will be available along with other guidance and options.&#13;
&#13;
Please ask kids to wash hands prior to workshop and kids will also be asked to use hand sanitizer before touching shared DJ kit (if this is a concern don&#8217;t worry, just take part in the workshop using your device that you brought). I will clean kit in between kids having a shot.

&#13;
Assembling the rocket is straightforward and as they're all made from white card and paper there are plenty of options for decoration or modification. We'll have some helpers on hand to provide guidance.&#13;
&#13;
Suitable for young children with supervision. The build involves mostly using scissors and tape, one step involves hot glue which requires adult supervision. Feel free to contact us beforehand if you want to check suitability: emf@adamgreig.com or extension 2440.&#13;

Instead it was used by all, as a communal good. Then some bright spark decided that ownership was a better idea, and &#8220;enclosure&#8221; carved up the country with walls and fences, and solidified class divisions that persist to the modern day.&#13;
&#13;
Now we&#8217;re seeing the same thing being tried on the Internet. Blockchains, crypto, and NFTs are trying to turn everything into something to be owned, attacking the very idea of the digital commons. And at the same time, they&#8217;re baking inequality into the system and unleashing a wave of hypercapitalist exploitation of the vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
Is this really what we want? How can we keep alive that utopian dream of an Internet that benefits everyone, fight back against digital enclosure, and send the con artists packing?</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-37-the-tokenisation-of-the-commons</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="550">James Smith</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="172" guid="892a6f00-d452-529d-8701-9e1d0c433b6c"><room>Stage B</room><title>The future of invention</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-04T10:40:00+01:00</date><start>10:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Advances in NLP and machine learning are allowing automatic processing of knowledge. An untapped potential of this revolution is the ability to change how people come up with ideas and solve problems. &#13;
&#13;
People tend to solve problems in linear ways. If my horse is too slow, I want a way to make it faster. It wasn't clear to many people of the 1800s that changes in industrialisation would lead to an entirely new way of going fast! &#13;
&#13;
So what happens when you do have all of the information, and when you can find subtle patterns occurring in vast swathes of data? What happens when an engineer's Alexa can tell you not just the answer to your question, but the answer to the question that you didn&#8217;t know you were asking?&#13;
&#13;
I would like to explore how AI may fundamentally change the human&#8217;s ability to think and invent, and the changes that this may lead to in society, drawing on my experience as the head of the world&#8217;s first AI augmented invention team with example patents and progress that has been made so far.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-172-the-future-of-invention</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1352">Chris Wright</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="341" guid="927c1369-e007-513a-b129-3e81efd86c7c"><room>Stage B</room><title>Wearable Fire Art</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-04T11:20:00+01:00</date><start>11:20</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Fire has been a ubiquitous technology for countless millennia, finding applications across many problem domains.

Despite this short lifetime, a homebrew community formed, has not gone away, and has only become more passionate since. &#13;
&#13;
The most tangible demonstrations of this passion are the extensive hardware modifications that have been developed by hobbyists to drag the Dreamcast kicking and screaming in to the 21st century. Users can restore internet connectivity, replace the PSU or the commonly-failing disk drive (originally based on bespoke optical media), and even enable true digital video output. &#13;
&#13;
I will talk about the origins of the Dreamcast homebrew scene, and the development and implementation of the most popular of these mods that ensure the Dreamcast will live on for many years to come.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-150-the-sega-dreamcast-frankensteins-console</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="309">Alex Rea</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="50" guid="183de126-0cc4-56d4-b9f9-f6331beeddc9"><room>Stage B</room><title>Astro Pi Mark II - how to send a Raspberry Pi from a factory in Wales to the International Space Station </title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-04T12:30:00+01:00</date><start>12:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>In 2015, as part of British astronaut Tim Peake&#8217;s Principia mission, the Raspberry Pi Foundation worked with the UK and European Space Agencies to send two Raspberry Pi computers to the International Space Station. Since then, these Astro Pis have run thousands of programs written by young people across Europe as part of the annual European Astro Pi Challenge (EAPC)&#13;
 &#13;
In 2021, after over two years of work, Space-X 24 took two new Astro Pis to the Space Station, where they have now been installed and, by the time EMF happens, will have been used to run even more exciting experiments designed by young people. &#13;
 &#13;
This talk will reveal behind-the-scenes details of the design, development and flight certification processes, including the manufacture of the space-grade aluminium flight cases, EMC testing, astronaut-friendly software engineering, and the issues that almost stopped the project. &#13;
&#13;
I&#8217;ll also describe some of the amazing experiments that have been designed and run by young people who take part in this year&#8217;s EAPC, and look at how they&#8217;ve used the new hardware including the IR sensitive camera and Machine learning Accelerator dongle. This will include photos taken as part of the Earth Observation experiments.&#13;

1. *A tip for when to take risks in board games and in life*. I will give an insight into how Google's AlphaGo AI chooses its next move, and give an example of a game that seems biased against you, but you actually have a slight advantage.&#13;
2. *Teaching a robot to tell jokes*. I will introduce the concept of factor graphs and describe an application of them to joke generation.&#13;
3. *The twitter bot that is playing the longest possible game of chess*. The World Chess Federation has some rules to prevent games from going on forever. I will outline a proposal by Tom Murphy VII for the longest possible legal chess game, and show the Twitter bot that I made to celebrate this achievement.&#13;
4. *A little theory of abundant numbers*. Abundant numbers, e.g. 12, 60, 360, are useful as they have many factors. I will show you how common these numbers are and how to find them.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-129-some-useful-maths</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="452">Alexander Bolton</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="13" guid="cbd8828a-f6c1-5bbc-9b61-bc7414e386dd"><room>Stage B</room><title>Automated Science at Sea - The Mayflower Autonomous Ship</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-04T15:50:00+01:00</date><start>15:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The Mayflower Autonomous Ship is a fully autonomous, AI powered research vessel, that will at the time of this talk will hopefully have completed its primary mission to cross the Atlantic from Plymouth UK, to Plymouth Massachusetts without any human intervention or control. The AI captain installed will guide the ship across the Atlantic, avoiding obstacles, plotting courses around the weather and balancing the many variables needed to safely cross one of the most dangerous oceans.&#13;
&#13;
As well as it's main goal to cross the Atlantic, it will also be operating a number of data collection and ocean science experiments to help researchers better understand our oceans, as well as developing new technologies to help automate science at the edge.&#13;
&#13;
This talk, will give a history of the Mayflower Autonomous Ship, a look into the exciting science conducted aboard including our Whale Song detector and Electronic Tongue, and how everything is brought together using open source and a great team.&#13;

Radios are transforming from the spaghetti of mind-bogglingly complex electronics into simple (but very fast) digitisers, and all the hard work is being done in software. Hence the name Software Defined Radio (SDR).&#13;
&#13;
Gnu Radio is a simple entry point to the world of SDR, and allows you to quickly prototype different kinds of radios by dragging, dropping, and connecting functional blocks.&#13;
&#13;
I'll demonstrate, and show that it's surprising what you can do with a radio receiver.&#13;

&#13;
I will discuss the three main types of leather and which to choose; the basic tools you will need to start making leather goods (and how to use them); how to dye leather; how to attach eyelets, rivets, and buckles; and the three main types of stitch.&#13;
&#13;
For the practical part of the workshop, you will be sewing a leather keyring using one of the most common types of stitch. Saddle Stitch uses one piece of thread with a needle at each end to create a stitch line that is both beautiful and resilient. The leather, thread, and tools needed to create your keyring will all be provided. Please bring your own scissors, or a knife to cut the thread, and a lighter if you have one.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-30-introduction-to-leatherwork</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="267">Mark Parnaby</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="94" guid="8fd692e4-91d3-5500-9b83-36f1446c8adc"><room>Workshop 5</room><title>Building mathematical structures with modular origami</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-04T14:00:00+01:00</date><start>14:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Work together to build the platonic solids.&#13;

The mythical "Philosopher's stone" was thought to be the missing key needed for that, but much to the disappointment of generations of alchemists, the elusive Stone was never found, and the promise of unlimited wealth remained a dream. Until less than a century ago. &#13;
&#13;
When British physicist James Chadwick discovered the nature of the neutron in 1932, it soon became apparent that these subatomic particles can change the composition of an atom's nucleus. By adding neutrons to a nucleus, or removing neutrons from a nucleus, the atom can be made unstable and forced to undergo changes, now known as radioactive decay. These nuclear reactions can change an isotope of an element into another isotope of the same element, or even into an entirely different element. By choosing nuclear reactions and decays carefully, it becomes possible to turn other materials into gold. Traditionally, nuclear reactions require a very large and expensive nuclear reactor or particle accelerator, but a clever hacker doesn't need any of these! &#13;
&#13;
This workshop starts with a 30 minute entry level introduction to nuclear physics to explain attendees the scientific principles of elemental transmutation. Attendees then build together their own Philosopher's stone with components that can be found in any hardware store, and finally use it to transmute (a few atoms) of liquid mercury into gold. After the workshop, attendees have the option to take their creation home.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-36-hacking-alchemy-turning-household-materials-into-gold</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="549">Yannick</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="167" guid="37804fb4-e76e-5dcc-99fd-78c1d02bc17d"><room>Workshop 5</room><title>Communication skills for Geeks</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-04T19:20:00+01:00</date><start>19:20</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>interactive workshop for up to 30 people on various, simple to implement, tips on communication skills.

This one-time jewel had been abandoned to decay and deprivation. The last 6 or 7 years have seen green shoots of regeneration begun by Turner Contemporary Gallery and is now rich in galleries, media consultants, music and film producers. Its High Street is an exemplar for retail re-purposing. Unfortunately, there remains a lot of deprivation and a widening digital divide.&#13;
&#13;
This talk is an engineer&#8217;s tale of moving to Margate from London. The opportunities, experiences and challenges had so far, and an ambition to bring more joy of tech to the area. I will talk about Margate's Maker community as context, and tell tales of working with artists and involvement with several community activities. I even mange to squeeze in a bit of IDEF0 modelling!&#13;

&#13;
The subsequent year I realised that the best defense against accidental occult computing was to do it on purpose so I embarked on a cyber-occult experience to blur the lines between magic and technology, beginning with writing a Tarot card filesystem (TarotFS) on Plan 9 from Bell Labs, the awkward cousin of Research Unix.&#13;
&#13;
In doing so, I discovered a lot about the value of participatory magical practice even when you don't believe in the supernatural (and how we all do it whether we realise it or not), the surprisingly short history of the separation between magic and science, and all the weird junk you can do with Plan 9 under the guise of "occult research" and how it's uniquely suited to the task.&#13;
&#13;
Along the way I've gathered a collection of grimoires (spell books) and other occult texts that instruct the reader on a plethora of "esoteric sciences" ranging from how to stop a magnet from working (you put a diamond next to it), how to appease all the gnomes that the earth is "full to the brim" of whilst you're searching for buried treasure, to how to construct a Hand of Glory.&#13;

This technology has global potential to disrupt energy and wastewater systems.&#13;
&#13;
Active Living Infrastructure: Controlled Environment (ALICE) is a "living" installation that communicates with microbes in real time by monitoring their electricity production so we can "respond" to them by feeding them with our liquid waste. Drawing together microbial metabolism, data, bioprocessor systems, artificial intelligence, low power electronics and digital displays, ALICE reveals the inner "life" and naturally-organised, imperceptible realm of microbes around us. To hold these digital "conversations" with microbes, ALICE uses the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) as a communications platform. MFCs are an organic energy source powered by microbes which facilitate contact between humans and microbes through electrical exchanges. The collected and analysed data can tell us about household resources, as microbes can give us information about our consumption, and reveal what we discard in our waste streams&#8212;while also powering our homes and, ultimately, cities.&#13;

Little IoT devices that brought computers, toys and board game pieces together. In 2011(version one) and 2012 (version 2) a commercial version, Sifteo Cubes, was released, but I was unaware, thinking the dream prototype was just that, a dream not a reality. They passed me by&#8230;&#13;
&#13;
 In 2014, the v2 software was open sourced - the inevitable precursor to failure - and the company bought by Drone/Robotics developer for the obvious design skills of the Sifteo team; they had, after all, reverse engineered and reapplied wireless keyboard controllers into one of the coolest toys ever! So, I came to them late. Too late. By 2015, the server the control software required, along with the online marketplace for the dozen or so games that were made, were long gone. The Sifteo cubes I&#8217;d just (re)discovered from a desperate eBay sale were now just useless, battery powered bricks. And they didn&#8217;t even click together!&#13;
&#13;
But I was stubborn. I wanted them to work. These little marvels of engineering and educational design. I had some of the software, a couple of the games, and none of the knowledge.

One of those films that slacks your jaw in the first five minutes and then it just gets worse. The Barkley Marathons is a documentary on the now-famous ultramarathon that takes place every year in Tennessee. Participants aim to complete five laps of a twenty-mile course through the woods that has no proper trail, using maps and compass. Some think the course is actually much longer. Even entering the event is a challenges with requirements being a closely guarded secret. Every year, 40 runners attempt to complete the course and usually, none succeed. A fascinating look into what drives people, sometimes to the edge of sanity.&#13;

In this talk I will introduce the basics of railway signalling, and look at how it has evolved over time - often in response to accidents and near-misses. You will find out how a single stray wire caused an accident that killed 35 people, why leaves on the line cause such a problem for the railways, and how signalling systems are designed to deal with the inevitable human error. Working from the early days of the railway to the present (and future), the talk will take you through a number of accidents, their causes and the improvements that were made after the accidents.&#13;
&#13;
This talk is suitable for any level of knowledge about railways - it aims to be understandable for complete beginners, and still have some interesting parts even for railway geeks.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-169-learning-from-accidents</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1349">Robin Wilson</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="237" guid="cb6e8981-a69f-58f4-8075-d6a7b9eb0ccf"><room>Stage A</room><title>asdkfldsalkasdf: Keysmashes, Sexuality and Mathematical Randomness</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-04T12:50:00+01:00</date><start>12:50</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>Keysmashes are way of expressing emotions through spamming random letters on a keyboard but what do they actually mean?

&#13;
By modern standards, its design has many unusual aspects, such as:&#13;
&#13;
- The logic circuits were made entirely from 3 input NOR gates.&#13;
- Design was split into 24 logic modules, but due to limits on gate/chip count per module, individual gates were sometimes 'borrowed' from unrelated modules.&#13;
- Shift and rotate operations existed, but were not available during interrupts.&#13;
- Numerical overflows disabled interrupts.&#13;
- There was no stack.&#13;
- Limited memory addressing range, combined with a need for ever more memory lead to a complex memory banking system.&#13;
- Word length was 15 bits, ones-complement (mostly).&#13;
- No floating point - everything done in integer&#13;
- programmer responsible for avoiding overflows.&#13;
- Single bit 'Up/Down' Analog to Digital conversion (kind of) throughout, with the curious side-effect that the faster the spacecraft was rotating, the slower the computer would run...&#13;
&#13;
On top of the limited hardware was built an impressive realtime system supporting cooperative multitasking, a virtual machine running interpreted commands, a powerful fault detection and restart system, and an innovative VERB NOUN user interface.&#13;
&#13;
This talk aims to describe the architecture, with particular focus on aspects which are unusual by modern standards.&#13;

But it wasn't always quite that way...&#13;
&#13;
This talk will be a potted history of the safety of the railways in the UK and Ireland, starting from the early days when signalling was thought of as an inconvenience, and anything with wheels on it which sort-of went round went on the track. Eventually, the railway companies learned the benefits of adopting safer methods of working (sometimes requiring some encouragement from the law), leading to the introduction of some Victorian methods we still use today. Finally, we look at the more modern era with the railway losing its way with privatisation, and onto the current time, where computers and paperwork solve everything. Perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
Featuring: Swiss Cheese, Charles Babbage vs. Brunel, working too hard, forgetting where you put your trains, losing your religion, a dark and stormy night, drunken driving, a loose screw, shifting foundations, and more.&#13;
&#13;
No previous knowledge of the rail industry is required. The talk will cover some recent fatal accidents at a high level.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-104-a-crash-course-in-railway-safety</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1851">Anthony Williams</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="242" guid="fd23d750-03ef-5428-a76a-71a2c82d22a5"><room>Stage A</room><title>The Digi-Gurdy: An electronic MIDI enabled Hurdy Gurdy project</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-04T16:20:00+01:00</date><start>16:20</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The hurdy-gurdy is an ancient musical instrument (10th century) with drones and melody strings bowed by a rotating wheel, played by pressing keys which contact them at different points. It featured in TV series such as &#8220;Black Sails&#8221; and &#8220;Walking Dead&#8221; as well computer games. A major barrier is that they are very expensive at thousands of pounds each and built to order with lead times of over a year. Rather like bagpipes, they are loud. For pipers, practice e-chanters are available while nothing similar exists for the hurdy-gurdy. The Digi-Gurdy project started as a 3D printed version of the keyboard part of the instrument in isolation, with some internal electronics, for my own personal use to learn a few tunes on. After posting on Thingiverse, a website for sharing 3D printed ideas, I had many requests from people asking me to build them one. This open-source project has developed through many variations which I would bring to the talk, resulting in an all laser-cut wooden full-size hurdy gurdy design with a realistic crank handle system and a detachable playable keybox for travelling. It is an electronic device, with correctly placed keys, that outputs data via the industry standard MIDI communications system for electronic musical instruments, via a USB cable to an attached or wirelessly paired phone or iPad running suitable MIDI player software. It is a low-cost way to enter the Hurdy Gurdy world and allows practice anywhere using headphones, thus preventing eviction or divorce!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-242-the-digi-gurdy</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1502">John Dingley</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="108" guid="be1ff212-6e21-5f16-b15a-110f7423fe68"><room>Stage A</room><title>A journey through philosophy: exploring metaphysics via memes and a sprinkling of pop culture.</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-04T17:00:00+01:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Over my time in academia, I've endured a number of existential crises whilst learning about the concepts within philosophy that are required in order to undertake academic research.

A problem shared is still a problem that keeps you awake at night staring into the abyss unable to function. But hey, at least now I'm not alone.&#13;

In order to explain these theories and share my recurrent episodes of screaming WHYYYYYYYY at the universe, I've collected a number of memes and references over the years to convey concepts such as what is it to 'exist', why the scientific method is just as 'made up' as anything else, how we define 'truth' and lots of other tasty things to create a pervasive, disjointed feeling that you just can't seem to shake.

After working on container ships as an engineer in the mid-2000s, it seemed every more unlikely. We didn't have a full-time Internet connection and all the vital systems were truly air-gapped. But things have changed - ships are becoming more and more connected and complex. &#13;
&#13;
As a result, 15 years later, I found myself sat in my pants on the sofa with the ability to control the steering on one of the world's largest cruise ships. We've been able to brick every PLC across tens of oil rigs, pay for food as the captain, and write rude words on the side of the ship. &#13;
&#13;
To get to this point, we had to go on a learning voyage across tens of different vessels, including offshore support tugs, super yachts, oil rigs and container ships. Join me on a whistle stop tour of what's on a ship, how it's all connected together, what threats there are and how we find the vulnerabilities. Lots of little tips and tricks that can help anyone examine industrial control systems, understand how they work, and then have a lot of fun with them!&#13;

Whether it's coming from space, from radioactive elements in the Earth, or from human activity, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere we go, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is happening all the time, and curiously, some objects in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.&#13;
&#13;
One instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-M&#252;ller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-M&#252;ller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. Attendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-453-build-your-own-geiger-counter</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="209">Yannick</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="448" guid="6795e170-84c3-5b40-a57c-1a64d9a65ccd"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>Layout the EMF badge</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-04T12:00:00+01:00</date><start>12:00</start><duration>3:00</duration><abstract>At this workshop, we will learn to design circuit boards by redesigning the EMF badge bottom PCB.

&#13;
Arduino is an amazingly powerful tool that is very simple to learn to use.  It was designed so that artists and non-geeks can start from nothing, and make something cool happen in less than 90 minutes.  Yet, it is powerful enough so that uber-geeks can use it for their projects as well.  &#13;
&#13;
This workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino.  Participants will learn to solder, learn everything needed to play with electronics, and make a TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in public places with the board they just soldered -- a fun way to learn soldering, Arduino (and electronics) basics.&#13;
&#13;

No signup or experience required.&#13;
&#13;
Location TBD on scouting, will announce at end of day 0. Check https://s.ai/emf or Twitter @saizai or ask in person (I'm the one with hat, glasses, and two white canes).&#13;
&#13;
We'll discuss &#8212; and practice &#8212; several very different meditation techniques, such as:&#13;
&#8226; breath&#13;
&#8226; empty mind&#13;
&#8226; parallel concentration / stack overflow &#8224;&#13;
&#8226; "inner sanctum" hypnotic induction &#8225;&#13;
&#8226; movement&#13;
&#8226; grounding &amp; shielding / energy play&#13;
&#13;
&#8224; tends to work especially well if you find "emptying your mind" difficult (e.g. due to ADHD)&#13;
&#8225; very simple, with script 100% disclosed beforehand &#8212; no silly stage tricks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We'll discuss several variants of the basic mechanisms, how to customise to your own preferences, and personal experiences (iff you choose to share) &#8212; but no religion, metaphysics, doctrine, or the like.&#13;
&#13;
Please:&#13;
&#8226; wear or bring something comfortable for sitting on grass/dirt&#13;
&#8226; bring a drink &amp; snack&#13;
&#8226; pee and stretch beforehand&#13;
&#8226; silence all electronics while at the workshop&#13;
&#8226; do (only) what works for you&#13;
&#13;
I use scripts (with included variation suggestions) that work for most people, but not everyone. Please diverge from my instructions if something else feels right. That's common, and kinda the point &#8212; particularly for the hypnotic induction, which needs to be tailored to your own experience).&#13;
&#13;
Likewise, if something feels uncomfortable or triggering, please switch to a different meditation exercise instead (e.g. the basic breath meditation we start with).&#13;
&#13;
What you share is entirely up to you. I won't call on you. If there's something you'd only be comfortable sharing privately, please find and talk with me at another time.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-151-meditation-for-hackers</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="441">Sai</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="456" guid="6a1b2ec3-a296-5375-94ed-bb6709aa1eb0"><room>Lounge</room><title>3D printed/open hardware lasertag</title><type>performance</type><date>2022-06-04T15:00:00+01:00</date><start>15:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>We will be running daily free (as in beer) lastertag events near the lounge daily at 3pm for 1 hour using 3D printed lasertag equipment running on open hardware/software.&#13;

&#13;
Protracker was the standard tool for making computer game music on the Commodore Amiga home computers of the 80s and 90s.  Using 4 channels of 8-bit sampled sound and a maximum of around 1MB of ram, making something sound good requires a few tricks.&#13;
&#13;
I'd like to share the mystery and wonder of Protracker - the Esperanto of tracker software - to a wider audience. &#13;
&#13;
In this workshop we'll demonstrate:&#13;
&#13;
how to sample your own sounds&#13;
how to rip samples from other peoples mods&#13;
where to find decent mods&#13;
how to remix mods&#13;
how to edit samples using amiga software&#13;
how to loop samples cleanly&#13;
how to make protracker patterns, and then assemble patterns into a song.&#13;
&#13;
You can follow along with a laptop and headphones!  You'll just need to install fs-uae (https://fs-uae.net) on linux or mac, or winuae (https://www.winuae.net/) on Windows **before** the workshop.  We'll be using ProTracker 2.3d from back in the day, or ProTracker 2.3f which is a recently bugfixed version.  https://github.com/8bitbubsy/pt23f&#13;
&#13;
If you've never seen a tracker, it's like a spreadsheet where each row plays a bunch of sounds.  Load a few samples, start it recording, and you can quickly make fun and catchy patterns using instruments, speech, singing, or drum loops.&#13;
&#13;
About your instructor.&#13;
&#13;
I was exposed to mods and amiga game music in the early 90s and my mind was thoroughly blown.  Through cover disks and PD (public domain) libraries I discovered Med, Sound Tracker, and  Octamed, all classic trackers.  But it was in 1993 when I joined the Amiga demoscene as a young teen that my eyes, ears, and mind were really opened.  Donning the handle Reflex, I first joined a group called Eltech and then later Grasshopper Developments, two mid-tier demogroups of the UK scene. Protracker was the standard that literally everybody on the scene used. I didn't release tons of stuff back then, but I was horse famous for a bit with some cheeky chip tunes and sampled songs about grasshoppers.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-68-how-to-make-a-cool-90s-protracker-module-on-an-amiga-or</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="839">DJ Narq / Reflex</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="155" guid="3c55f124-94b3-547b-95e5-08e38452a8b1"><room>Workshop 2</room><title>Applied String Theory</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-04T16:30:00+01:00</date><start>16:30</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>At this workshop we will be using strings or cord to make cross body carrier for your water flask in macrame technique. &#13;
&#13;
The Art of knot-tying dates back several centuries. It is believed that the word macrame is derived from the Arabic macramia which means "ornamental fringe". Macrame was first brought by Arabs to Spain and after spread from Spain to Italy and eventually to the rest of Europe. Sailors played a large role in keeping Macram&#233; alive and sharing the art with new lands. Knots had many practical uses aboard their ships and decorative knot-tying kept hands and minds occupied during long voyages.&#13;
Modern macrame is having a huge revival. The repetitive tying of knots is soothing and meditative and great for mindfulness. It is also a craft that requires very little &#8211; just cord and scissors. There are few basic knots in macrame and, once you have mastered them, the possibilities of what you can create are endless.&#13;
&#13;
During the workshop we will create a crossbody water flask holder/carrier using cotton string.&#13;
The basic model requires about 15 meters of cord and around 60 knots in total - cotton cord and the printed instructions will be provided. The project can be completed in under two hours. Participants can keep and take home their creations.&#13;

The most successful robots are those which are truly &#8216;heboi&#8217;: pathetic, and constructed without the technology or skill that you&#8217;d usually expect in a robot fighting tournament.  &#13;

Join us to watch the robots battle it out and take joy in failure!&#13;
&#13;
All are encouraged to enter a robot to the contest, simply visit the information desk to register your robot prior to the tournament.

&#13;
The strange thing is that any reasonable person that takes the time to investigate their long, if rarefied, history concludes that they exist. I don't mean they exist in the obvious sense that a weird-looking shiny party balloon at a distance is an unified flying object that exists. No - for well over 70 years, hundreds of thousands of individuals have witnessed clearly visible flying craft - disk-shaped, cigar-shaped, triangles, "Tic-Tac's" - performing seemingly impossible aerodynamic feats in our atmosphere. That's just the start of it.&#13;
&#13;
Until recent years, getting an overview of this inscrutable subject has been an unreasonable amount of effort for the average person. "The Phenomena" by James Fox, released in 2020, is a feature-length documentary film which gives a compelling, but sober, history of the subject. It has great production values, is very well sourced, and features interviews with extremely high-ranking individuals in intelligence, defence, aviation and governance as well as ordinary people with extraordinary evidence. Put simply, this film will leave you convinced that we are being visited by aliens.&#13;
&#13;
Hang out afterwards for an informal discussion of what it all means, and tell us about your UFO sightings!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-566-film-screening-the-phenomenon-2020</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="55">Jeff Gough</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event></room><room name="Youth Workshop"><event id="380" guid="6ad14916-b5a5-5879-94bd-c01cdc9d4072"><room>Youth Workshop</room><title>Bubble Fun!</title><type>youthworkshop</type><date>2022-06-05T09:30:00+01:00</date><start>09:30</start><duration>0:50</duration><abstract>Who can make the biggest bubble?

After the story there will be a textile arts and crafts workshop where children imagine what life may be like for their decedents, and design and make clothing for something they may be doing in the future. Nothing is too fanciful, we have had everything from future space fashion on Mars, to time traveling fish people. &#13;
The workshop gets people thinking about choices we can make now, and issues that we may need to overcome in the future, in a fun and empowering way. Less eco anxiety and doom scrolling, more creativity and joy. &#13;

Of course this assume everything goes to plan and works as expected, there is a non-zero probability some parts of talk will change from "this is how this works" to "this is how this should work, but this is why it does not".</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-120-announcing-the-emf-schedule-like-its-the-80s</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="543">Dan Nixon</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="54" guid="de4807e8-292c-5b05-b9ce-a78557f2b1b5"><room>Stage A</room><title>A Life Without Stickers is Possible But Useless</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T10:40:00+01:00</date><start>10:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Stickers are an essential part of our culture, our values.

&#13;
Over time, it has increasingly become the case that there is no simple answer. The degree to which people can now pick and choose what they want in terms of (de)masculinizing and (de)feminizing effects/procedures is astonishing - even to many transgender people and medical professionals providing them care. Much of this customization is especially attractive to non-binary (neither strictly male nor female) individuals.&#13;
&#13;
From simply unbundling things that have historically been considered package deals to experimental surgeries and outright biohacking... come learn about the gender transition "secret menu", compared and contrasted with the traditional options.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will cover the following topics:&#13;
&#13;
Social transition (briefly), including presentation, pronouns and name changes.&#13;
&#13;
Medical transition, including hormone replacement therapy, surgeries and specialized drug regimens.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-185-hacking-gender-transition-&#224;-la-carte</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1395">Ryan Castellucci</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="374" guid="c88abbbb-2627-5638-9dc3-f49c94114666"><room>Stage A</room><title>Who watches the scooters?</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T12:50:00+01:00</date><start>12:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>You put a bunch of scooters online and you have an app that can tell you if you're near one so you can hire it.

&#13;
This talk provides a high-level overview of authenticated encryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305, and X25519 Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange (both used in modern protocols), and how we overcame the challenges of implementing them efficiently in Scratch.&#13;
&#13;
The talk is aimed at those with an intermediate background in programming and maths, but not necessarily cryptography. Hopefully I'll make modern cryptography look a bit less inscrutable, while also showing that Scratch is a "real" programming language.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-163-modern-cryptography-from-scratch-in-scratch</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1162">David Buchanan</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="136" guid="52438e04-67ae-5fdb-8003-1ce4bc1ae804"><room>Stage A</room><title>Building a Home-Made Enigma Machine</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T14:10:00+01:00</date><start>14:10</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>"The Enigma Machine was an electro-mechanical device used in the mid-20th century to encrypt communications. An ingeniously simple and elegant combination of cogs, wires and lamps, all fitting into a portable case, it provided some of the strongest encryption possible at the time. During various Covid-19 lockdowns, I decided to re-enact this important development in the history of computing, through a project to build an Enigma machine at home, using modern components and digital design techniques. The completed project is made out of cheap hobby electronics parts and laser-cut wood, and can be assembled entirely by hand, with no gluing, screwing or soldering. I will reflect on what this process taught me about the challenges of electromechanical computing, security and usability, the changes in modern manufacturing and supply chains, and their impact on computing. This will be followed by a Q&amp;A and a demonstration where you can see the home-made Enigma machine in action and have a go at encrypting and decrypting a message."</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-136-building-a-home-made-enigma-machine</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1052">Reuben Binns</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="239" guid="7405c39c-53b6-595c-9605-a32c2ef77d98"><room>Stage A</room><title>Why is it so hard to do nice things, that make a difference, with other people?</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T14:40:00+01:00</date><start>14:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>On the surface of it it seems simple: tech and maker types have skills they enjoy using, and community groups have unmet needs that could be helped by these skills. Why then does it feel so incredibly hard to make these collaborations happen in reality? And why does it feel even harder to do it while meaningfully fighting the Tories, transphobes, racists, and neo-Nazis?&#13;
&#13;
This talk takes it back to the roots of why we are here and what we&#8217;re doing to explore why. I will break down how harmful neoliberal methodologies that dominate tech groupthink such as Human Centered Design and Design Thinking fundamentally restrict what can be made whilst presenting a cardboard cutout &#8220;ethics&#8221; that falls over at the slightest touch.&#13;
&#13;
Instead I introduce Community Technology Partnerships, a methodology developed at Geeks for Social change in collaboration with Manchester School of Architecture, based on &#8220;the capability approach&#8221;. This is a human development approach used by the UN and WHO developed by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen that asks what people are able to *be* and *do,* and works to remove blockers to these concrete actions and states. This approach recentres community strengths at the centre of more holistic tech interventions that restore power to the people who need it the most.&#13;

&#13;
The scrapyards are now filled with slightly broken EVs and Hybrid cars, and almost no one knows what to do with them. As a result the parts they are made from are very affordable and available for repurposing and hacking into your own projects.&#13;
&#13;
The project is far from complete so there is nothing to bring to the show as I was hoping but there is lots to talk about and discuss regarding the state of play of hacking scrapped and discarded power inverters. &#13;
  &#13;
The motorbike project uses a battery from a BMW i3 electric car, the motor is from a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV &amp; the main power inverter for driving the motor is from a hacked Prius running open source firmware with the motorcycle running gear from used motorbikes and a whole host of other bits connected together in ways never intended.&#13;
&#13;
The project is only possible using the work done by the EV car hacking community Openinverter.org and their community forum which have reverse engineered the EV power controllers allowing you to run open source firmware on them with some minor alterations. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-49-how-im-building-my-monstrous-electric-motorcycle-from-hacked</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="639">Russell Couper</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="219" guid="9240eceb-80a3-52db-9a24-7b60946d7e59"><room>Stage A</room><title>On taking your daft ideas seriously (or, how we accidentally made an art robot business)</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T17:10:00+01:00</date><start>17:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>I&#8217;ve made some installations and art robots over the years, getting gradually more ambitious, and somehow this has turned into a job and a robot company, Air Giants.&#13;

Transport for London provides an API ("TrackerNet") to get departure boards for all the stations -- but (ab)using that information to track the journeys of each individual train has proven much harder than expected.&#13;
&#13;
I'll explain how I built a system to squeeze useful insights out of an API not really designed to provide them -- including a fair few workarounds for TfL's capricious signalling systems, way more graph theory than I have any right doing, and why I now really hate the District Line. You'll be able to see how applying a carefully tuned pile of random maths lets me go from a chaotic jumble of data to a near-perfect model of the Tube map!&#13;
&#13;
I'll also cover the practicalities of running this system, explaining how I packaged it all up into a website people can actually use without getting banned by TfL for using their API too much or overloading the server I run it on.&#13;
&#13;
Don't let the mention of graph theory scare you off; this talk should be appropriate for all audiences, and should appeal to anyone with a casual interest in railways, open data, or infrastructure.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-182-london-underground-open-data</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1388">eta</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="187" guid="3e8a20d4-f7e3-5fc2-9ff6-badaf25dc3b8"><room>Stage A</room><title>EMF 2022 Infrastructure Review</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T18:30:00+01:00</date><start>18:30</start><duration>0:50</duration><abstract>Members of the EMF infrastructure teams (network, power, lighting, video, telephony) will give some insight into how we delivered these services this year.

&#13;
The workshop will be run using the JavaScript Starter Snake as the example, but Battlesnakes can be written in any language that can have a web server. &#13;
&#13;
If there's time we may even pit some baby snakes against each other in a tournament. &#13;

The hardest part is devising open-ended interaction, spaces that invite people to reveal their authentic selves, and to connect with those around.&#13;
&#13;
But trends in technology have gone in the opposite direction. Whether it's for usability, profit, safety, profit or 'sparking joy', or profit (it's usually profit), 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s. Human-Computer Interaction has become a very planned affair. And the more planned it gets, the less room there is for the ambiguous messy bits that make us human.&#13;
&#13;
Could it be another way? Presenting... &#13;
&#10031;&#10031;&#10031; Rewilding Human-Computer Interaction &#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#13;
where, instead of designing micromanaged user experiences, we create open-ended spaces that embrace the unknown, the messy and the human. The ills of the online world are not problems inherent to its users but to systems that prevent those users from existing fully as humans. The solution is not more design, but more wildness.&#13;
&#13;
Soapbox aside, I do have a speculative project to share on this front.&#13;
&#13;
In a collaboration with artist/AI researcher Panagiotis Tigas, we've been training Variational Autoencoders on improvised dance, and from these devising personalised interfaces that respond to creative movement. The resulting system allows you to move through a 16-dimensional parameter space while following the intuitions of the body. As an entangled black box system, I can't explain how to use it, but it can be learnt by the body through exploration and play.&#13;

Tourism films are no use in a war, so the Council turned their topics towards more cultural content as a softer kind of propaganda. Thus began a decade of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almost totally forgotten in Britain. &#13;
&#13;
Between 1940&#8211;1950, the British Council produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain covering sports, manufacturing, landscapes, art, architecture, public healthcare, the justice system, democratic process, public institutions like the National Trust and the BBC, and more besides. &#13;
A far cry from the Ministry of Information's rigid style, this collection features some of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (2001: A Space Odyssey, Cabaret, Superman), and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes). &#13;
&#13;
Distributed to over 100 countries worldwide, the films are stunning, dated, funny, and bizarre by turn. They depict beautiful countrysides, optimistic cities, strong industry, forward-thinking social structures, and hardworking, happy people. They depict exactly the popular image of 1940s Britain that persists to this day... &#13;
That may not be a coincidence. &#13;
&#13;
In this talk I'll cover the history and development of this film collection, how it was shaped, who saw the films, their staggering success, and their untold global legacy.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-281-this-is-britain-british-cultural-propaganda-films-of-the</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1578">Sarah Cole</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="157" guid="b7a98b94-b26a-5cb3-9959-22538ca7239a"><room>Stage B</room><title>Building a copper telephone network at EMF</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T12:00:00+01:00</date><start>12:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>An overview of how I went from thinking about bringing a handful of analog telephones, to building a copper telephone network covering most of the EMF festival site. &#13;

Science backs up what we know as a fundmental truth - that getting out into nature is good for our wellbeing. You might be surprised just how good. Not only does walking boost creativity, but looking at nature can restore our capacity to pay attention to other things. That&#8217;s what makes the natural environment the perfect backdrop when you need to innovate, create or simply recharge and regain focus.&#13;
&#13;
This session will share some of the research, give you ideas on what you can do, and give you the motivation to get out more and take your thinking outside.&#13;

You'll learn the truth about online dating, how not to create a pie chart, and the real cost of having a million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
Fact Machine is a stand-up PowerPoint show exploring how, like some members of the mass media and political establishment, you can use facts and figures to prove anything you want&#8212;if, like said politicians and media types, you don&#8217;t worry too much about the small matters of &#8220;the truth&#8221; and &#8220;journalistic integrity&#8221;. Armed with a well-researched (and fully referenced) slideshow, I will take you on a journey through the minds of the statistically average single American: what they like, how they spend their time, and what they write when they leave online shopping reviews. Just don&#8217;t look too closely at how I apply the facts to reach my conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
Expect bad puns, even worse science, and the statistical key to getting yourself a date on the internet&#8212;if you&#8217;re willing to be a little &#8220;economical with the truth&#8221;.&#13;

Eschewing the oscillators of a traditional synthesiser for the resonances of homemade electro-acoustic sound sources and piezo based noise boxes, these are heavily processed with granular synthesis and micro looping using a palette of effects he has designed and built and housed in a repurposed bright orange metal chest. Taking cues from the world of sound art and horror film soundtracks but always trying to apply pop sensibilities, the result is lush and cinematic soundscapes topped with delicate melody.&#13;

As well as an immersive show in its own right, this performance will provide a good companion piece to Scott Pitkethly's talk (An introduction to building your own digital audio effects) on building the instruments he will be using to play live.&#13;

Is there dark magic in tech? And what does that have to do with a teleporting duck in a classroom?!&#13;
&#13;
We often hold creating 'a magical experience' as a key goal for design - it's fun, engaging, sometimes even playful, and it makes complex things look simple. But technological magic has a dark side too, especially when trying to help people learn and feel confident about technology.&#13;
&#13;
By its nature, magic you experience is not under your control: it's a trick, and you're not supposed to be able to understand it; magic is inscrutable, and for many, that's disempowering.&#13;
&#13;
In designing the BBC micro:bit and surrounding tools, we've thought a lot about the balance between the positive and the negative sides of creating of a magical experience.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will reflect on our struggle to balance technical authenticity and honesty with the need to provide a high quality experience that excites and inspires students.&#13;
&#13;
It will explain how we attempt to present simple, understandable analogs of more complicated, magical technology in order to help students gain a sense confidence with the tech around them.  However, it will also look at how we've resorted to using our own bits of (nearly) invisible magic to make this all work nicely in a classroom.&#13;
&#13;
Through this discussion we'll look in detail at the presentation of the micro:bit's IO, the way the micro:bit's USB interface works, the microphone privacy LED, the web-based compiler and the simple radio communication.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, I will look beyond micro:bit at how using this concept of balancing transparency and magic can help us build better, more trustworthy tech.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-267-making-technology-deliberately-distinguishable-from-magic</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="790">Jonny Austin</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="319" guid="e2b48b41-9dea-573b-8f42-92dc634de551"><room>Stage C</room><title>Unfinished Projects: Breaking the cycle</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T12:00:00+01:00</date><start>12:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>A few of us struggle with completing projects.

Over the years I have worked and volunteered for many organisations aiming to increase the number of marginalised people entering the tech industry. In this talk, I will share my experiences of coding bootcamps, NGOs, and software agencies in London, Palestine, and Ghana, and some of the geopolitical and cultural hurdles I have seen along the way.&#13;

With the aim to "do good", and improve diversity in any space, it's difficult to keep in mind that we are creating opportunities for others. Others, with their different experiences, different views and different cultures. Others, that are different to ourselves.

This talk will first discuss the importance and direction of fashion-tech in our society today and in the future. We will also discuss lessons learned from our collective 15 years of experience as fashion-tech designers and common issues designers face creating such garments. From our experience, we have begun research and development of a kit, that requires no coding and no soldering, to help designers move past technological barriers and enable more creative exploration during the design process. Lowering technical barriers not only affects fashion-tech but opens new possibilities for art and innovation.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-144-fashion-tech-advice-from-a-farm-boy-and-a-comp-sci-geek</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1061">Shannon Hoover and Sydney Pratte</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="58" guid="b2d2ffce-9b95-5447-991c-f1b6fe2c7fbb"><room>Stage C</room><title>Machine learning with a pile of matchboxes</title><type>talk</type><date>2022-06-05T18:00:00+01:00</date><start>18:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>In the 1960s, Donald Michie built MENACE: the matchbox educable noughts and crosses engine.

How long did it take you to solve your first Rubik&#8217;s Cube? Did you ever? A speed cuber can do it in about eight seconds. This heartwarming documentary follows two of the greatest &#8216;cubers&#8217; in history during the build up to the world championships. One king of the cube versus the upstart newcomer. What we find is not a typical cut-throat competition but friendship, kindness and a champion who embraces their autism as a superpower. This is a short but life-affirming journey with some amazing cube-solving skills.&#13;

But if you don't know what it is, or how you can use it to do all sorts of cool things, then this fun and easy workshop is for you.  &#13;
&#13;
Arduino is an amazingly powerful tool that is very simple to learn to use.  It was designed so that artists and non-geeks can start from nothing, and make something cool happen in less than 90 minutes.  Yet, it is powerful enough so that uber-geeks can use it for their projects as well.  &#13;
&#13;
This workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino.  Participants will learn everything needed to play with electronics, and use a solderless breadboard to make a TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in public places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics.&#13;
&#13;
At the end of the workshop attendees get to take the TV-B-Gone they have built away with them.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-452-arduino-for-total-newbies-solderless-version</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="209">Mitch Altman</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="131" guid="d50620ff-9ade-5c78-b2e0-8e8086653576"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>Rakit Drum Synth - Build/Solder your own Drum Synthesizer</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-05T16:00:00+01:00</date><start>16:00</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>Participants can build their own Electronic Noisemaker or Synth Kit, learn to solder and become familiar with circuit boards and components along the way.&#13;
&#13;
The Rakit Drum Synth is based on the (now rare) Boss PC-2/AMDEK PCK-100 percussion synthesizer. The synth is triggered by a piezo disc which is sensitive to how hard you tap the top panel giving subtle differences in the envelope. The sounds are generated by a VCO optionally modulated by a frequency sweep, LFO, Pitch CV or all three. Its a true analogue synthesis engine.&#13;

We will be using eco-acoustic sensors to record underwater wildlife all weekend (linked to our planned installation). In this workshop, we will be getting into the river to try to find the creatures that we have (hopefully!) recorded. We&#8217;ll demonstrate techniques that can be replicated by anyone, anywhere, to give a quick indication of how healthy or polluted a river is. We will start by listening to our recordings to see if we can guess what we have found. We will then give a 15-min crash course on identifying eight types of invertebrates that can be found in rivers, each of which indicates different environmental conditions. Under the direction of workshop participants, our workshop leads will get into the river and collect some wiggly creatures. Everyone will count which species we have found and we will finish with a score that indicates how healthy or polluted the river is. If we have time, we will also demonstrate some simple tests to detect pollutants in the water. Participants will receive information to take home with them about different techniques that they can use to monitor river health for themselves, ranging from in-river surveys to Arduino sensor builds.&#13;
&#13;
Warning: We are not planning for participants to go in the water, but they may come into contact with the water so please cover up any cuts or broken skin.&#13;

Brush your hand across the same pillow to turn up the volume? Smart textiles can let us interact with our computers and devices without needing to use a touch screen. In this workshop you will design and build your own smart pillow, which when connected to your laptop, can be programmed to control your favourite streaming services. You will start by prototyping your design with paper circuitry and then will start sewing. Bring along your laptop and all other materials will be provided including an Arduino-compatible microcontroller and Trill capacitive sensor by Bela. No coding experience is needed, but some previous sewing experience will be helpful. If you don&#8217;t finish sewing your pillow in the workshop, you can take the necessary materials home with you.&#13;
&#13;
Full documentation, including Arduino library installation instructions you can follow ahead of time at: https://github.com/theleadingzero/smart-pillow/wiki</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-238-make-an-e-textile-smart-pillow</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="480">Becky Stewart</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="241" guid="411c185c-aa19-5089-b511-79b7d6a27b2f"><room>Workshop 4</room><title>3D Printing Menstrual Technology </title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-05T16:00:00+01:00</date><start>16:00</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>In this workshop we will show you how to modify a parametric CAD model of a menstrual cup mould using Openscad (https://openscad.org/). We will cover openscad basics and explain how menstrual cups are made.&#13;
&#13;
This workshop will be run by The Crimson Wave Project, a Community Interest Company that is working to improve access to sustainable and body safe menstrual products that are suited to all the people who need them, alongside providing inclusive education around menstrual and sexual health more broadly, and one of our main goals is to create customisable menstrual cups. In this workshop, we will show you the basics of openscad and explain the process of creating 3D menstrual cup models. We will bring a resin printer (Elegoo Mars 2) to demonstrate how to make these moulds using resin, and practice casting them in silicone for the first time. &#13;
&#13;
We will also share some fun period related facts, such as what people used before pads, tampons and menstrual cups were invented, how the ancient Romans felt about menstrual blood (spoil alert: they believed it could blunt knifes), and how menstrual blood was used as a torture device against Islamic fundamentalists in Guantanamo Bay. &#13;
&#13;
ALL GENDER IDENTITIES WELCOME AND NO EXPERIENCE (OF OPENSCAD OR MENSTRUATING) NEEDED. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-241-3d-printing-menstrual-technology</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1558">The Crimson Wave Project</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="434" guid="1a24d3a3-9996-52b9-b5a6-a31b2e0d2c21"><room>Workshop 4</room><title>Winners Screening</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-05T19:00:00+01:00</date><start>19:00</start><duration>3:00</duration><abstract>Winners Screening</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2022-434-winners-screening</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="2043">FieldFX</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event></room><room name="The Bomb"><event id="517" guid="c4545219-4ee5-5263-bec6-d5d26c16cad3"><room>The Bomb</room><title>The Bomb Defusal - Escape Game</title><type>workshop</type><date>2022-06-05T14:00:00+01:00</date><start>14:00</start><duration>10:00</duration><abstract>A terrorist organization has planted a bomb in the null-sector, which will detonate soon.

Space is fun. Receiving data from space is even better.&#13;
&#13;
TinyGS is an open community-run network of Ground Stations distributed around the world to receive and operate LoRa satellites, weather probes and other flying objects, using cheap and versatile modules. https://tinygs.com/&#13;
&#13;
This hands-on workshop will cover building, programming and setting up your own TinyGS station.&#13;
&#13;
Participants will build their very own quarter-wave ground plane antenna, and base station to take home. All they have to do is plug the box into a USB charger.&#13;
&#13;
Payments for this workshop can be taken via Revolut, Paypal or cash in person. &#13;
&#13;
No amateur radio license is required to operate the station, only if you wish to send data to space.  &#13;
