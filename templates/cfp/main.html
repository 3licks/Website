<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
    <p class="emphasis">Electromagnetic Field is a UK camping festival for those
      with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, artists,
      geeks, crafters, scientists, and engineers. It's happening near
      Ledbury, Herefordshire on {{ fancy_dates }} {{ event_year }}.</p>

    <p>We're looking for talks, performances, installations, and workshops.
       We're especially keen to hear from people with
      <a href="{{ url_for('base.diversity') }}">different backgrounds</a> than
      you'd expect to find at a technology conference.</p>

    <p>At previous events we've heard about everything from genetic modification
      to electronics, blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering
      to lock picking, computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to brewing.
      If you're enthusiastic about it, we are too! You don't need to be a
      professional or an expert to present: <strong>impostors are
      welcome</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Money</h3>
    <p>EMF is a non-profit community event, entirely run by unpaid volunteers. All of
      the ticket cost goes directly towards turning a field into a habitable and amazing place
      to spend a weekend, and everyone who attends contributes to making the event a success.</p>

    <p>We'd like everyone who participates to buy a ticket and stick around for
      the whole event. We don't have the budget to pay speakers, although we have a
      limited amount of money set aside to help those who otherwise can't afford to come, or
      who can only attend for the day of their talk or workshop. We'll ask you about this if your
      proposal is accepted.</p>

    <p>Everybody who has a proposal accepted is guaranteed a full ticket for a discounted price.</p>

    <h3>Selection</h3>
    <p>After you submit a proposal, it will be considered anonymously by a diverse
      selection panel. For more on the EMF selection process, see our
        <a href="{{ url_for('.guidance') }}" target="_blank">guidance</a>.</p>
