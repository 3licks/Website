DESCRIPTION:The aerodynamics of turbomachinery\, precise CAD\, testing\, i
 nduction motor design and the importance of prime numbers were all topics 
 that I failed to consider when I set out to design a desk fan that looks l
 ike a jet engine.  In this talk I will describe all of the fascinating thi
 ngs that I only discovered in retrospect as I took a donor desk fan and ma
 de something that was worse in almost every single way.

 is v0.1: we finished soldering the boards on Thursday\; we don't know how 
 well they work\; the code (currently only for Android) continues to be dev
 eloped as of Friday.  The workshop's goal is to open the project to a larg
 er community\, spurring further development.  At worst\, you'll get to wal
 k around wearing tin foil\, a bathing cap and electrodes\; at best\, you'l
 l be able to identify various EEG signals on your phone.  If you can\, ple

DESCRIPTION:A talk about my Music library project [http://github.com/Godle
 y/Music-Library]\, a multi platform app  written for my final year project
  as part of my BSc Computer Science degree last year. The app is intended 
 to be an open and extendible platform for organising sheet music (the nota
 tion for classical music given to players in an orchestra or similar)\, a 
 problem which hasn't really been solved by other software even though ther
 e's plenty of software which can help you compose new music. \nTalk will c
 over reasons I think the problem hasn't been addressed\, problems working 
 with music formats\, some thoughts on how we perceive sheet music and Opti
 cal Music Recognition\, particular issues technically with Python and forc
 ing a single codebase to work on Windows\, OSX and GNU/Linux\, and how the
  app turned out in the end.

DESCRIPTION:There are limits to our ability to learn and process informati
 on\, but the amount of information we have access to is growing faster tha
 n ever.\n\nIn this talk I explain the origins of the term “information o
 verload” and describe what physiological and psychological effects being
  overloaded causes. With reference to developing for the web\, I describe 
 specific\, manageable sources of information overload for us as developers
  and show how development in general is a continuous learning process.\n\n
 In order to hack our how we learn\, it’s important to understand a littl
 e about how learning happens. To that end\, I outline the points of attack
  by relating the current understanding from the field of cognitive psychol
 ogy on how our thinking and learning processes work.\n\nI’ll use simple 
 examples throughout to show how we can manage our projects more effectivel
 y\, write clearer\, more maintainable code\, and actively manage our own l
 earning journeys\, as well as assisting the journeys of those we work alon
 gside. With this knowledge we should be able to make our development proce
 ss more efficient and reduce the risk of information overload both for our
 selves and others.

 e behind. The contemporary storyline follows real-world events surrounding
  data privacy\, and the game has been developed to be heavily moddable\, a
 llowing players to create their own levels and stories\, and even their ow

DESCRIPTION:Within the UK\, school computing has changed beyond recognitio
 n in the last 10 years. 2012 saw the Royal Society publish the hugely infl
 uential “Shut down or restart?” report\, which has been followed by a 
 complete curriculum turnaround… in England. What’s followed has been i
 nvigorating and challenging\, but it’s not been easy. In England\, skill
 s gaps are a problem. In other parts of the UK there seems to be more of a
  “sit back and wait to see how those English people get on” attitude. 
 For the enthusiastic outreach nerd\, this is an interesting time: working 
 in after school clubs\, one-day sessions\, robot open days\, summer camps\
 , and tech activity development can be hugely fun and massively rewarding.
  It can also be utterly frustrating\, demoralising\, and can sap the life 
 force from your very soul (if you had one to start with). \n\nThis talk wi
 ll describe what works\, what doesn’t work\, what you (yes you) can do\,
  and why we should take this seriously. What should you do if you’re try
 ing to run a workshop for 40 kids with varying levels of experience? How c
 an you help a group of homeschooling parents teach programming? How can yo
 u write something that’s used more than once? \n\nThe currently anonymou
 s proposer has a decade+ of experience as a tech person trying to encourag
 e the world that tech is actually fun. This will be a frank talk about rea
 l workshops and real kids\, with practical advice and a barely concealed u
 ndertone of ranty feminism. \n

  that can give us root on our toys.\nRather than focus on specific bugs in
  particular devices\, this talk will describe a number of generic attacks 
 that can be attempted against a wide variety of networked 'things'.  The a
 ttacks range from the trivial that anyone with a soldering iron and a few 
 bits and bobs could attempt\, through those that require moderate linux kn
 owledge\, to those that require a disassembler and a knowledge of reverse 
 engineering.\nIt should be of interest to anyone who would like to root th

 to actual life (with a brief segue into what "life" actually means anyway\
 , and why it's a trickier question than you'd think)\, ongoing efforts to 
 create programmable (Turing-complete) synthetic DNA structures and allogra
 fted cells for therapeutic use\, and make an argument for regarding human 
 DNA as the tape in our own personal Turing machine.\n\nOf course this is a

DESCRIPTION:CANUTE\, an open source multi-line refreshable Braille display
 . The project has been developed using Bristol Hackspace as a base and wor
 kshop facility. We are a Not For Profit venture and are working on open so
 urcing the project because having an open source design and data protocol 
 will open up the avenues to information and equipment it can link into and
  information it can display. Available displays are at best two lines\, Ca
 nute will be 8 or 16 lines and affordable.\n\nThe blind community are curr
 ently poorly supported with literature as very little is transferred to bu
 lky Braille paper format and this has an impact on literacy and employment
  and access to modern communication. So much information is displayed 'on 
 the screen' and Text-To-Speech is not always convenient (and is often inco
 nvenient) and is a very different experience to reading. We aim to reverse
  this with CANUTE which will be the world's first electronic multi-line re
 freshable Braille display. It will be an entirely new class of affordable 
 device to bring Braille to people who would otherwise be unable to afford 
 anything other than massive\, bulky hard copy Braille from a very limited 
 source.\n\nAfter 4 years of development on gifted and sponsored budgets in
  the corner of a Hackspace using Chinese motors and gears from ebay\, lase

 ere once only accessible to the biggest players are now available at low v
 olumes and at low cost. Find out how you can apply modern techniques to yo
 ur next hobby project and achieve professional quality\, all while making 
 it easier to publish your designs.\n\nThis talk includes:\n\n* Use of CAD/
 CAM tools for schematic capture and PCB design\n* Techniques for making PC
 Bs yourself\n* Getting PCBs manufactured cheaply\n* Surface mount assembly
  and soldering\n\nThis talk will not assume prior knowledge of electronics
  manufacturing or much in the way of electronics design in order to follow
  the talk. This talk will cater to your curiosity if this area is new to y
 ou but will also aim to be informative for someone who is experienced in d
 esigning circuits and wants to achieve a slick result.\n\nAfter this talk 
 you will understand the steps involved in producing a piece of electronics
  that has a professional look and feel and you will very likely be excited
  about applying these techniques to your next project\, whether it's your 
 first attempt at a simple through-hole design with two components or a den
 sely packed surface mount project.

  between software as a restricted\, expensive product or software developm

 re.\nSo are we still a DIY grassroots knowledge-sharing community? Are our
  hackspaces as open and inclusive as we think (or thought) they are? Do we
  still have the same values that we did when the first UK hackspaces opene

DESCRIPTION:Biography in hacks of how we started a maker space charity and
  community. \n\nI am am a co-founder of Create Space London a now Register
 ed charity\, co/working maker space and artist studio.\n\nWe established i
 n 2011 with literally no idea of how to do any of what we now know or even
  really any clue of what was involved\, just an idea of the kind of space 
 we wanted to create.\n\nEvery step of the way has been a complete DIY hack
  job that somehow seemed to work\, from the very first cut and paste busin
 ess plan\, to using recycled stud wall timber to fit out the space\, fabri
 cating an exposure unit from air conditioning making and scrap wood that i
 s now used to run courses\, scrapping old CAT5 for cash and refitting it a
 t a profit paying for new plaster board to continue the fit out and more. 
 \n\nThis is the story of establishing our organization as told through the
  series of DIY hacks that now serve over 200 members and is completely fin
 ancially independent. I would accompany the talk with a series of photogra
 phs showing the hacks the selves and other related moments in the space.

DESCRIPTION:I am a mathematician (working mostly in three-dimensional geom
 etry and topology) and mathematical artist (working mostly in 3D printing)
 . I'll talk about some 3D prints I designed to help try to visualise four-
 dimensional objects. Just as a shadow of a three-dimensional object squish
 es it into the two-dimensional plane\, we can squish a four-dimensional sh
 ape into three-dimensional space\, where we can then make a sculpture of i
 t. If the four-dimensional object isn't too complicated and we choose a go
 od way to squish it\, then we can get a very good sense of what it is like
 . I'll talk about the sphere in four-dimensional space\, the four-dimensio
 nal polytopes (which are the four-dimensional versions of the three-dimens
 ional polyhedra)\, and various sculptures\, puzzles\, and virtual reality 
 experiences that have come from thinking about these things.

DESCRIPTION:In 2012 a full break of PEAP/MSCHAPv2 (PPTP VPNs\, WPA-Enterpr
 ise\, etc) was shown by doing a brute-force of the DES keyspace using FPGA
 s and added support to cloudcracker.com to make this attack accessible to 
 everyone (and not just people with a >$100k FPGA cluster). The talk will a
 lso serve to release a new DES cracking service that will provide more of 
 a general purpose interface allowing you to crack most protocols and file 
 formats that use DES assuming you have enough known-plaintext to verify ke
 ys. Also\, some new attacks that leverage the system to do interesting thi
 ngs will be covered.

DESCRIPTION:Every modern computer processes digital data on successive tic
 ks of a synchronising "clock". We are all familiar with using the speed of
  this clock to reason about the performance of our devices: in 2000\, a de
 sktop might have run at 500MHz\; now\, it would not be unheard of to see a
  5GHz clock. The existence of this clock makes processor design very conve
 nient\, and in the early days clocked designs generally proved faster and 
 used fewer components than their unclocked counterparts.\n\nHowever\, in r
 ecent years we have seen a plateau in increasing clock speeds: computers a
 re no longer getting "faster"\, per se. We have uncovered many disadvantag
 es of using clocked circuits: the clock is power-hungry\, it is difficult 
 to distribute across a modern chip\, all circuits are constrained to opera
 te at the speed of the slowest\, and clocks may cause electromagnetic inte
 rference to other nearby devices.\n\nTaking inspiration from the human bra
 in\, this talk will examine two fundamentally different methods of computa
 tion that are either asynchronous or analogue in nature. They do not rely 
 on a clock to advance the state. We shall simulate and explore these metho
 ds through interactive\, graphical means. Asynchronous circuits have the p
 otential to be faster than clocked designs and require far less power. Ele
 ctronic analogue computers have the further advantage that they do not suf
 fer from numerical errors that arise from approximating real numbers using
  a finite number of bits. Might one of these techniques shape the future o
 f our technological society?

DESCRIPTION:How fast is it possible to complete a game like Super Mario Wo
 rld\, if you could control every frame of input to ensure a perfect run?  
 Tool-assisted speedruns are recorded frame-by-frame using emulators which 
 allow slow-motion gameplay\, going back and undoing mistakes\, and even us
 ing bots to search through many possible combinations of inputs. By removi
 ng human limitations\, these speedruns get closer and closer to the theore
 tically perfect play.\n\nThis talk presents highlights from the last 15 ye
 ars: frame-perfect movements\, exploiting bugs and oversights\, and manipu
 lating randomness to get miraculously good fortune. There will be videos o
 f speed runs\, including both popular and obscure games\, and even a game 
 completed in less than 0.3 seconds of gameplay time.\n\nThere are many tec
 hniques which are used in making a speedrun. Sometimes people will disasse
 mble the game's code to understand how it works\, in order to find new way
 s of beating it. Sometimes people will find and exploit bugs\, allowing th
 em to move through walls\, go faster than normally possible\, or skip whol
 e sections of the game. In extreme cases\, bugs allow players to execute a
 rbitrary code\, allowing them to take complete control of the console.\n\n
 In short\, this talk is about taking games to their very limits.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:How might you re-order wagons in trains without lifting them o
 ff the tracks or prevent trains from colliding when you cannot see where t
 hey are? What does a train travelling through a station indicate about sim
 ultaneous events and how do railway junctions lead to problems in ethics? 
 This talk combines several interesting problems in railway operation\, wit
 hin the context of real railway operations\, showing surprising applicatio
 ns in computing they inspired.\n\nShunting yards present logistical proble
 ms arising from the marshalling of wagons. The UK's former largest yard ne
 ar Sheffield was so complex it required a paper tape era computer to opera
 te. However\, in computing we find their structure used in diagrams for pr
 ogramming language grammars and a type of parsing algorithm known as the s
 hunting yard algorithm which we'll see in operation.\n\nThe computer scien
 tist Edsger Dijkstra devised many railway-themed computing ideas. Dijkstra
 's algorithm finds the shortest route between stations\, a method independ
 ently discovered by early rail planners in the UK. Thanks to railway signa
 lling\, Dijkstra introduced semaphores into concurrent programming. We'll 
 show how the concept works both for railways and concurrent systems and ou
 tline the historical context of rail accidents.\n\nRailways introduced uni
 versal time. Einstein's celebrated thought experiment involving a moving t
 rain changed how we understood simultaneous events. Distributed systems re
 ly on proper ordering of events. We'll explore these problems plus solutio
 ns.\n\nThe talk includes the Trolley Problem that first arose in philosoph
 y but is now the subject of its own vibrant meme.

DESCRIPTION:A lot of noise\, extensive discussions and many articles have 
 been written lately due to the recent\, so claimed\, airplane hacks. It is
  indeed very difficult\, up to impossible\, to find information about the 
 actual security of an airplane's systems if you are not actually the perso
 n responsible for designing and building such systems. Of course\, it is u
 nderstandable that these details regarding these systems will never become
  available to the general public for security reasons.\nDue to my backgrou
 nd in security\, I always looked at the airplanes from a different perspec
 tive and after reading so many articles online I decided to share with you
  what I have come across after all these years. Personally\, I am an airpl
 ane enthusiast and I have been studying and learning about airplanes all m
 y life\, mostly as a hobby. I started with the best flight simulators I co
 uld get my hands on\, sat down with many real pilots to learn all the tech
 nical details and I have a few flight hours in a real simulator of a Boein
 g 737-800. \nThe purpose of the talk is to present you with small truths a
 nd facts about airplanes I managed to gather over the years. The facts I a
 m going to present you with will help you better understand if what you re
 ading about airplanes' security is actually true or a misleading story bas
 ed on fictional facts and assumptions. \nThe presentation will allow you t
 o draw your own conclusions about the security of airplanes' avionics and 
 in-flight systems while looking a bit closer to the so called in-flight en
 tertainment systems. \nFasten your seat belts and join me to an interestin

DESCRIPTION:At Delft University of Technology we are developing a six legg
 ed robot inspired by a beetle. Instead of building complex and expensive r
 obots\, we  build simple and cheap robots. This allows us to construct a l
 ot of robots and use them as a swarm. Just like computer engineers found o
 ut that some problems (e.g. travelling sales man) can be solved by copying
  behaviour seen in nature\, the same thing applies to hardware. For exampl
 e\, we see that animals have multiple layers of intelligence: reflexes nee
 ded to stay alive are generated by the spine\, and the brain adds a layer 
 of more complex\, but less stable intelligence. This can be copied to robo
 ts by implementing the spine in a microcontroller\, and implementing the b
 rain on a processor running linux. These robots are build in all sizes. Ra
 nging from a model you can hold in your hand\, up to a model that is over 
 half a meter in length.

DESCRIPTION:About four years ago I built a diesel motorbike\, the most suc
 cessful of three I have made. I would like to share the experience of how\
 , using minimal tooling and tight finances\, I successfully adapted a road
  registered motorcycle to be powered by a diesel engine and the problems I
  encountered to complete it.\n\nThe drive to do such an unusual thing was 
 partly the engineering challenge but mostly the amazing fuel economy and I
  now  get about 140mpg from it. The spark that started this bike was from 
 an engine given to me at my 40th birthday camping weekend. You'd think it 
 was a thoughtful and expensive gift but my friends actually found it on to
 p of a rubbish dump attached to an abandoned refrigeration unit. However i
 t was of good stock and worth mending and eventually made its way into a b
 ike that covered over 40000 miles before needing attention. \n\nAnother in
 teresting fact is that I built it in about a week due to a personal crisis
 . It was built mostly in the spare room of my house using parts I had I th
 e attic left over from other projects and support from a generous friend w
 ith a big lathe. \n\nI have attend the annual diesel bike meeting regularl
 y since it started eleven years ago as well as occasionally visiting the o

 witch-mode power supplies (one step-up\, one step-down) using tiny SMD par
 ts. They're going to work. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A

DESCRIPTION:Holonomic drive robots\, ones that can independently drive eac
 h of their degrees of freedom\, are incredibly agile. If one finds oneself
  having to participate in some kind of robotic jousting\, such a robot is 
 an excellent choice. I will show an example of one\, which recently won a 
 duelling contest organised by everyone's favourite small fruit based compu
 ter company\, and walk through the various systems\, gotchas\, maths\, mec
 hanical design\, electronics and software needed to create her.\n\nSlides 
 are online at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kUL0ilc0b5qm6v7doisW

 am their bionic limbs\, and gain extra senses. My implanted NFC transponde
 r allows me to unlock my phone with a wave of my hand\, but uniquely ident
 ifies me to any nearby antenna.\nIn this talk I present my preliminary res
 earch into the idea of an API for the human body. What does it mean for a 
 human to become assimilated into the Internet of Things? Why would I want 
 to expose part of my body in a globally addressable space?\nThrough the pa
 rtiality of web standards\, the irony of illegal prime numbers\, the intim
 acy of teledildonics\, and the perversity of JavaScript\, this short talk 
 will inspire you to become a cyborg\, or teach you how to hack one.

DESCRIPTION:The story of programming prodigy and information activist Aaro
 n Swartz. From Swartz's help in the development of the basic internet prot
 ocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit\, his fingerprints are all over the 
 internet. But it was Swartz's groundbreaking work in social justice and po
 litical organising combined with his aggressive approach to information ac
 cess that ensnared him in a two year legal nightmare. It was a battle that
  ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron's story tou
 ched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was
  a celebrity. This film is a personal story about what we lose when we are
  tone deaf about technology and its relationship to our civil liberties. S

DESCRIPTION:A dazzling\, surprising and sometimes hilarious animation in t
 hree different styles that interprets a ancient Indian story. Roger Ebert 
 declared “I was enchanted. I was swept away”.\n\nSita is a Hindu godde
 ss\, the leading lady of India’s epic the Ramayana and a dutiful wife wh
 o follows her husband Rama on a 14 year exile to a forest\, only to be kid
 napped by an evil king from Sri Lanka.  Despite remaining faithful to her 
 husband\, Sita is put through many tests. Nina (the filmmaker Nina Paley h
 erself) is an artist who finds parallels in Sita’s life when her husband
  – in India on a work project - decides to break up their marriage and d
 ump her via email. Three hilarious Indonesian shadow puppets with Indian a
 ccents – linking the popularity of the Ramayana from India all the way t
 o the Far East - narrate both the ancient tragedy and modern comedy in thi
 s beautifully animated interpretation of the epic.\n\nIn her first feature
  length film\, Paley juxtaposes multiple narrative and visual styles to cr
 eate a highly entertaining yet moving vision of the Ramayana. Musical numb
 ers choreographed to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw feature a c
 ast of hundreds: flying monkeys\, evil monsters\, gods\, goddesses\, warri
 ors\, sages\, and winged eyeballs. A tale of truth\, justice and a woman
 ’s cry for equal treatment. Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline as \\
 "The Greatest Break-Up Story Ever Told.” From: www.sitasingstheblues.com

DESCRIPTION:Minusonic is a project designed to detect the micro-sonic\, th
 e minuscule sounds in the environment around us.\n\nWe’ve developed the 
 Minusonic board v1 which has a small microphone attached that we’ve enha
 nced through experienced circuit-know-how\, to make it ultra-sensitive to 
 tiny frequencies and decibels of sound. You are then able to plug in your 
 headphones and hear these sounds that are normally outside of our hearing 
 range\, from the sound of ants footsteps to those of a spider\, any insect
 .\n\nIf it's too loud to hear the insect on camp\, there are recordings of
  the sounds of ants to hear and you can still test the mike out in its sho
 e box. It can detect lost of other everyday sounds that we wouldn't normal
 ly hear.\n\nBring an insect if you find one and lets try!\n\nhttp://minuso
