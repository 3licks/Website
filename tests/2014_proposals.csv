28,Collaborative Science Fiction Film made at EMF,"I have organised, directed and run safe shoots for the BBC for half a decade and I would like to make a science fiction short during the 3 days of EMF camp.  The script would be pre-written and use EMF as a backdrop.  The story I have in mind involves a disheveled character in a suit who wakes up on the field and spends a disorientated night wandering around the festival, talking to people and experiencing the events.  As sun rises our hero is retrieved by a spaceship piloted by aliens eager for a report on the inhabitants of Earth.  (This is very much a first idea, I expect it to evolve)

A professional actor will be filmed over the course of the festival, with the bulk of the filming (especially effects-heavy shots) happening early on.  Filming could potentially happen in as little as a single day if this improves logistics.

Although it is ambitious to expect the entire film to be completed by the end of the festival, there is certainly the opportunity to show some of the results of filming at a talk towards the end of the Festival.

A measure of pre-publicity will be needed as attendees to EMF will be invited to appear in the film, or to help make it.  Anyone who wants to help with special effects will be able to retrieve footage from a common network location and upload their processed contributions to the same place.  Attendees will also be able to look up a shot list of desired angles (eg Timelapse Sunrise/Wide shot of field/People at talk) and film content for inclusion into the film.

Equipment will be of the guerilla shoot variety (micro four thirds or DSLR camera, portable sound recorder, low profile boom mic, minimal battery powered handheld lights).  That is not to say that it cannot be clever.  Home-made rigs can offer unusual perspectives or options for timelapse shooting and Attendees would be welcome to bring along or make such filming rigs, for example, go-pro or similar cameras can be used to give specific effects or height (eg using a tethered blimp) .

There is also the potential to partner with equipment manufacturers who might be willing to sponsor this endeavour in terms of loaning kit. I have contacts I could approach at Holdan, Panasonic, Nikon, Zeiss, Robert White, BBC and various Arial Filming Companies any of whom might also be interested in speaking.

Myself and some other interested crew members already have EMF tickets as well as most of the kit required for filming.  I am confident I can get hold of any missing equipment by borrowing it.

I would like to apply for funds to enable us to pay the actor.    ",3 days,f,f,workshop,,Everyone,

34,"Glass music, the nervous system, mesmerism and the threshold of beauty and harmony","My talk would be based upon one I gave at the ICA a couple of years ago, but that I would like to revise and extend to include a more thorough history of the musical instrument of the 1800s, the Armonica, and its connections to mesmerism. My talk would give a short explanation of how an Armonica works, before expanding upon its connections to mesmerism and feminine distance.

Physician Franz Mesmer notably chose the ghostly strains of the Armonica to soundtrack his mesmeric séances, wherein aristocratic individuals would dip their hands in vats of water filled with magnets supposedly charged with Mesmer’s notion of “animal magnetism”.

The transcendental notion of the feminine came into focus through the glass instruments of the 1800s, whose cold ghostly tones were linked to both healing and hysteria during their short fashionable period. Benjamin Franklin’s glass Armonica was thought of not just as a very becoming instrument for the ladies of the era, but a later poetic symbol of feminine liminality itself. Glass might be thought of as a kind of musical ‘other’ which in its transparent purity was thought to create a bodiless sound, leaving the act of performance to a phantom body.

Although sounding quite serious, I did find the quite remarkable history of the Armonica raises much laughter, especially when in the context of critiquing the ridiculous gender models of the 1800s.

At worst, it is literally folkloric - because no maps exist of cabling runs at the local level, engineers have regressed to an undocumented code of signs sprawled on the pavement to mark cable runs.

This has tangible effects on society’s discussion of the internet- because we cannot see the underlying structure, we conceive it as a series of tubes connected to clouds. We create false boundaries between the physical and the virtual, and let our data flow freely into different and dangerous jurisdictions. We cannot discuss centralisation because our data centers and switching rooms are inaccessible.

An encounter with hierarchical structures while charting his family tree led him to Javascript as a general language for describing secular actions (like all good Lutherans of the time, he acknowledged that /heilige Handlungen/ should be carried out only by members of the priesthood), but as the sophistication of his requirements increased across the course of his life, he was driven to create idioms that would lay much of the groundwork for future developments in the language.

Participants in this very special JS Bachshop will have the opportunity to consider the use of motifs to ease maintainability, the difficulties of using callbacks to implement counterpoint, recently-unearthed innovations in Baroque-Driven Development, and just how far you can stretch a single pun. Audience participation recommended, and will probably involve singing or pretending to be the Elector of Saxony.

By day, I am lucky enough to work as the head of research for MWR InfoSecurity, doing research into new technologies, and supporting colleagues doing research. I also spend a fair amount of my time encouraging research as part of the culture of the company, and developing and educating people on how they might be able to improve their approach to research.

Rather than give a technical talk about computer security research (although I might use some technical examples during the talk), I would like to talk about methodology, and how I approach new topics. This has changed dramatically for me over the years, and I'd like to present the refinements I made along the way. Most of the key points of this talk are likely to be ""common sense"", but I find it useful to hear them from someone else, as taking your own advice can be challenging while in the middle of trying to solve a particular problem.

Some of this talk is likely to relate to topics outside of computer security, and I hope that people who might attend this talk will leave feeling less intimidated about the prospect of doing research into areas they are not familiar with, whether this is computer related or not.

A brief outline:
- Choosing a topic (specific implementation vs technology)
- Defining ""success"" criteria
- Reviewing current work
- Gathering information
- Tooling (existing vs bespoke, programming language choice)
- Documenting findings

At the end of the talk, I will present the outcome of some of my own research. This is partially because they are good examples of how research can be fun (e.g. implementing a Flappy Bird clone that runs on a mobile payment terminal - http://vimeo.com/89924160), and also partially to show people that behind the flashy demos (which is usually all that the public sees) there is often a structured and well thought out research project, which was equally important to the success of the research than the technical skills being demonstrated.

Many people know about 3D printing now, or at least have heard of it. However the machines available to normal people are not capable of making anything other than plastic parts - which are sometimes quite fragile.

Traditional metal casting can make parts of very high strengths, for use in structurally important areas. Turbine blades for jet engines, pistons for combustion engines and so on. Traditional metal casting requires expensive moulds to be created, which takes its use away from home-engineering for all except a few.

However the two processes can be joined, to produce the mould from a home-made 3D printer for use to make traditional metal castings. In this way structurally useful parts can be constructed from equiptment with an expenditure of a few thousand euros.

This talk will focus on the use of 3D printed parts to make investment castings in Aluminium.",45 mins,f,f,talk,repeat,,

This talk explores the problems with the reductionist deficit based model of mental health diagnosis and talks about an alternative Integrated Model for ADHD.  The traits that occur together in people with 'ADHD' appear to be caused by a difference in executive function.  Understanding more about the executive function allows insight into the challenges faced by people with this condition.  However some of these traits such as deep concentration(hyperfocus) and creativity are highly valuable and therefore ADHD/HFA might be more usefully understood as a set of exceptionalities and not a medical disorder or a disability.    ,30 mins,t,f,talk,none,,

This talk is an introduction to the project and a call for further involvement, in particular for those with an interest (professionally or otherwise) in education.

In principle a lesson plan using the BaseBot could encompass aspects from visual design, through mechanical assembly and fabrication of custom parts, electronics and software. The complexity could range from very basic - create goggly eyes, make custom graphics, use an existing circuit to drive the robot around a course, to very involved - design and fabricate custom PCBs, modify the laser templates, implement sophisticated GPS and sensor driven navigation, make a system to drive around the space and tweet any unusual temperatures and so on.

109,How to be an Effective Terrorist: fear and loathing in cyber security,"The biggest problem facing cyber security is the fear. Too often the cyber security industry trades on the threats that lurk and the low level of understanding and awareness that most users have (and I say that as a cyber security consultant…). The average user, meanwhile, is aware that there are dangers in cyber space, that there are ‘hackers’ who can ‘steal’ their information, but they do not know how that really happens or why they should, for example, have strong passwords.
The problem with fear is that, so often, it is not empowering. Fear is undermining, off-putting and breeds insecurity. Literally, in this field, fear causes cyber insecurity.
This talk borrows from psychology and sociology to argue that if we want better cyber security, we have to connect the dots for people to enable them to control the dangers online and not simply the fears. Rather than simply scaring people with the threat, we need to explain how what they do fits into the bigger picture and, most importantly, we need to give them a clear map of good behaviours.

There’s a long history of localised grassroots innovation around sexual health, and lots of projects exploring what 3D printing has to offer to medicine and healthcare. In this workshop, we bring these two elements together. We’ll encourage participants to go beyond about just printing objects to consider what the qualities of digital fabrication - localisation, mass customisation, digital blueprints - could bring to sexual healthcare. Using foresight analyses, we’ll also encourage people to think about how social, political, and environmental factors might affect sexual healthcare in coming decades. We will use guided ideation to come up with objects, services, and scenarios for the year 2025. Participants will leave the workshop having thought and talked about how sexual healthcare might change in the next ten years, and having produced sketches, models, and other descriptions of their ideas and thoughts.

143,What do we have in Computers?,"Not very long ago an idea in mathematical logic got instantiated inside a dumb machine that can do a few simple things very quickly.
It is at once a machine, like the printing press but also a way of expressing ideas, like mathematics or musical notation. We are so early in the process of dealing with this invention/discovery that we confuse the tool and the topic - we call it Computer Science but it's like calling mathematics measuring stick science. What we have is a new way of unambiguously describing procedural knowledge and we have no idea how it will change our culture.
At the moment there is a priestly cult around people who know the secrets, we are treated well because we are scarce - like scribes in ancient Egypt, and we are similarly instruments of power, can we afford to ignore it?
But what happens when *everyone* can do it? What about when we can use it to learn other things the way we now read to learn about things we enjoy.

I want to share my favourite examples of using computers to improve our understanding in ways impossible before, including
 * pocket calculators vs slide rules
 * computational geometry vs pencil and compass constructions
 * exploring fractals in Logo
 * 'Thinking on the page' - How mathematical notation makes calculation easier
 * simulating evolution

I work as a scientist and had to learn to program on the job, after doing a biology degree that contained no maths or computational content. Last year I looked at the content for the same degree, ten years on and to my horror, it's exactly the same. Yet many biologists are expected to write or at least engage with software, usually learning these skills at the same time as being expected to deliver results and papers. It's easy to catalogue mistakes beginning programmers make, or to ridicule people's ignorance of tech and coding, but how does that help the situation? Is it the fault of the PhD student I'm working with that their code was full of filepaths that exist only on their own machine, because nobody pointed out that that was a problem?

In this talk, I want to defend shitty programming that works-a Zen & The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance approach to learning, as it were. I'd like to outline some of the issues that scientists learning to code on the job might face, and also acknowledge how learning some software engineering skills will help your science progress faster and more reproducibly, with a few (not original) ideas about what those helpful things might be.

Also may include a bit of a rant about the kind of comments that might make someone feel like they don't belong and a gentle nudge towards ways of encouraging learners.

Teaching Information-Security to young people at schools alongside

schools in today’s world. Couple this with the growing concern and the
very likely possibility that there will be a shortage of security
professionals in the future (did someone mention skills-shortage),
something needs to be done. Two computer security students from the UK,
Dalian Terry & Sam Sanoop, for the past year set up their own initiative
ECPC (Early Computer Programming Club) which provides learning of
programming fundamentals to children aged 6-10 as an after-school activity.

What else do we teach a generation that has a better understanding of
technology from a younger age? Our research, and working with schools in
the UK, has taken led us to teaching young teenagers, some as old as 16,
the basics of security as fun after-school workshops. Whether that is
basic web application or network infrastructure security, they love
levelling up their hacker fu.

This talk focus on the journey that we have taken in UK schools with
young kids and teenagers in the different areas of computing and
computer security. We’ll present the questionable and admirable changes
being put in place to national curriculum by governments, and how we
should tackle a serious issue before it is sat staring us right in the
face, alongside research we feel should be shared in the information
security community. This talk also include many activities and resources
we have designed and used.

This talk will show how the 'lessons learned' within the UK can be
applied to interested parties throughout Europe, and discuss our
experience in this most interesting of journeys. If you have children,
or are a educator of children, in fact have any contact with children,
we are sure you'll find something of interest within this talk.

We'll use this data to create a concise description for any commercially available beer. These descriptions will draw out the differences between the different techniques, at an intuitive level. We will then look at ways to quantify the distance between documents, which will then be used to show how similar various beers are. By the end of this talk, the audience should have enough of an understanding to use document-level NLP and be able to apply it to their own corpora of interest. And they may learn a few things about beer.",45 mins,f,f,talk,repeat,,

To do this effectively, we need to be able to quickly and cheaply show how our ideas would work on physical radio sets, because this is still how the majority of people listen.

This talk is about techniques we've developed to do this, from helping people to describe what they want from a radio, to filtering out bad ideas (""cat wigs""), to prototyping experiences on physical devices using a Raspberry Pi and web technologies. The talk will involve some lightweight paper prototyping, I'll also demonstrate my ideal radio, and give people pointers on constructing their own for listening to EMFM.

226,Hacking with Psychedelics - The uses of these amazingly powerful substances,"An introduction to many uses of these amazingly powerful substances, including use for programming and other creative endevours.

Psychedelic substances, and their real powers are little known to most people in main stream society. I believe this is of great detriment to humanity. As we start to come out of the dark ages of drug prohibition, I hope to encourage more people to explore these substances and use them for the benefit of themselves, their work, and the world.

I will outline some uses of these substances: their uses in programming, engineering, and science, artistic practice, medicine, and simply for enjoyment.

I will describe how certain substances can be used, and what each can be used for, including the use of LSD in both large doses, and microdosing, and the use of ayahuasca, mushrooms, and ketamine.

I will also talk about safety, risk reduction and legality of some substances in various countries and how they can be obtained. This will not, however, be an encylopedic talk on such matters, which can be researched on the web by those who may have been inspired by this talk to learn more.",30 mins,f,f,talk,some,,
