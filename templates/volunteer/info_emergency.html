  <h2>In Case of Emergency</h2>

  <p>Hopefully we wonâ€™t have any emergencies, but here's what to do if you do encounter one. Your priority should always be to ensure your own safety before attempting to help others.</p>
  
  <h3>Fire</h3>
  <p>If you encounter a fire (and it's not meant to be there), follow the steps below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Notify HQ via radio or phone (1011), making sure to clearly describe the location.</li>
    <li>Ensure people are clear of danger.</li>
    <li>If it is safe to do so, attempt to put out the fire.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>First Aid</h3>

  <p>In most cases people who need first aid should make their own way to the first aid tent, which can be found near the bar.</p>

  <p>If someone is unable to safely get to the first aid tent, request the first aid team either via radio, or by calling First Aid: 1008 / First Aid Emergency 1009. Unless you are qualified to do so, or the person is in imminent danger, you should not attempt to perform first aid yourself.</p>
