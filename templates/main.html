<h2>What?</h2>

<p class="summary">
Electromagnetic Field is a three-day camping festival for people with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, geeks, scientists, engineers, artists, and crafters.</p>

<p>There will be people talking about everything from <b>genetic modification</b> to <b>electronics</b>, <b>blacksmithing</b> to <b>high-energy physics</b>, <b>reverse engineering</b> to <b>lock picking</b>, <b>crocheting</b> to <b>carpentry</b>, and <b>quadcopters</b> to <b>beer brewing</b>. If you want to talk, there'll be space for you to do so, and plenty of people who will want to listen.</p>

<h2>Tell me more!</h2>

<p>Aside from the organised talks and workshops, attendees are forming <a href="http://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Villages">villages</a> and planning events of their own, day and night. Wander between tents and you might come across someone teaching safecracking, or accidentally stumble into a late-night jam session using instruments constructed from circuit boards and glowing wire. If you decide to come with friends, maybe you should <a href="http://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Villages">host something of your own</a>!</p>

<p>The camp will be littered with interesting things to play with and explore; extraordinary vehicles and glowing objects can be found in every corner. No matter what your skill level is, there will always be something to do and someone to talk to at the bar.</p>

<p>As well as the usual camp facilities like hot showers and running water, we're also providing power to every tent, and <a href="http://blog.emfcamp.org/post/27143646219/emf-camp-the-site-and-networking">very fast internet access</a>, both wired and wireless.</p>

<p>EMF is a volunteer effort by a non-profit group, inspired by European and US hacker camps like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Camp">CCC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_at_Random">HAR</a>, and <a href="http://www.toorcamp.org/">toorcamp</a>.
</p>

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Friday <b>31st August</b> - Sunday <b>2nd September</b> 2012.</p>

<p>Events and activities will run throughout the day and into the evening, everything else (chats, debates, impromptu circus performances, orbital laser launches) will run as long as your collective energy lasts.</p>

<h2>Where?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=52.061&amp;lon=-0.710&amp;zoom=16">Pineham Park</a>, Milton Keynes, UK.</p>

<p>Milton Keynes has great transport links to the rest of the UK and Europe. It's only 40 minutes on the train from London, and the site is easily accessible from the M1 motorway.</p>
