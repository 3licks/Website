  Staff our vehicle entrance gate, and help escort vehicles around the site.

  This role can involve a lot of standing around or walking - chairs will be provided to sit down between vehicles, but it will still be outside.
  
  You will need to intercept all vehicles coming to our vehicle entrance gate, coordinate with our siteops and logistics teams via radio, and for attendee vehicles that are loading and unloading, one volunteer will walk their vehicle to and from the loading point.
