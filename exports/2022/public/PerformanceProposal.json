Feel the love, feel the music, don\u2019t hold on, let go - hack the planet!\r\n\r\nInspired by attending EMF in 2018 and hearing Ian Softley's chat before the special screening of Hackers, this unique vinyl DJ set will transport you back to a time around when the film was released in the UK in the 90's.   \r\n\r\nTom\u2019s started DJ'ing in 1994 at parties and club nights around Edinburgh before becoming a resident DJ at Camel Beats in 1998.  The Arabian Knights brought new energy to the underground club scene in the City and Camel Beats was regarded as one of the best techno clubs at the time.  With music influences deeply rooted in Chicago House, Detroit Techno and emerging European sounds, bringing along a box of specially selects records from over 23 years ago and mixed with soul - this will be a special experience not heard for decades.",

                "published_description": "Hebocon is Robot Wars for those who are not technically gifted.  Twirling assemblages of junk face off against hot glue monstrosities, whilst some contenders might fail to move at all.  \r\n\r\nThe most successful robots are those which are truly \u2018heboi\u2019: pathetic, and constructed without the technology or skill that you\u2019d usually expect in a robot fighting tournament.  \r\n\r\nJoin us to watch the robots battle it out and take joy in failure!\r\n\r\nAll are encouraged to enter a robot to the contest, simply visit the information desk to register your robot prior to the tournament.  We\u2019ll also be running a robot building workshop for anyone who\u2019d like to construct (or embellish) their robot at EMFCamp prior to the tournament - see the separate workshop event for details.",
